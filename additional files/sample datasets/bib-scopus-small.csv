Unlike most computer programs that are used for bibliometric mapping, VOSviewer pays special attention to the graphical representation of bibliometric maps. The functionality of VOSviewer is especially useful for displaying large bibliometric maps in an easy-to-interpret way. The paper consists of three parts. In the first part, an overview of VOSviewer's functionality for displaying bibliometric maps is provided. In the second part, the technical implementation of specific parts of the program is discussed. Finally, in the third part, VOSviewer's ability to handle large maps is demonstrated by using the program to construct and display a co-citation map of 5,000 major scientific journals. © 2009 The Author(s).",Bibliometric mapping; Journal co-citation analysis; Science mapping; Visualization; VOS; VOSviewer,,"Ahlgren, P., Jarneving, B., Rousseau, R., Requirements for a cocitation similarity measure, with special reference to Pearson's correlation coefficient (2003) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 54 (6), pp. 550-560; Bollen, J., van de Sompel, H., Hagberg, A., Bettencourt, L., Chute, R., Rodriguez, M.A., Balakireva, L., Clickstream data yields high-resolution maps of science (2009) PLoS ONE, 4 (3), p. 4803; Borg, I., Groenen, P.J.F., (2005) Modern Multidimensional Scaling, , 2nd edn., Berlin: Springer; Börner, K., Chen, C., Boyack, K.W., Visualizing knowledge domains (2003) Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 37, pp. 179-255; Boyack, K.W., Klavans, R., Börner, K., Mapping the backbone of science (2005) Scientometrics, 64 (3), pp. 351-374; Chen, C., (2003) Mapping Scientific Frontiers, , Berlin: Springer; Chen, C., CiteSpace II: Detecting and visualizing emerging trends and transient patterns in scientific literature (2006) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 57 (3), pp. 359-377; de Moya-Anegón, F., Vargas-Quesada, B., Chinchilla-Rodríguez, Z., Corera-Álvarez, E., Munoz-Fernández, F.J., Herrero-Solana, V., Visualizing the marrow of science (2007) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 58 (14), pp. 2167-2179; de Nooy, W., Mrvar, A., Batagelj, V., (2005) Exploratory Social Network Analysis with Pajek, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Eilers, P.H.C., Goeman, J.J., Enhancing scatterplots with smoothed densities (2004) Bioinformatics, 20 (5), pp. 623-628; Fruchterman, T.M.J., Reingold, E.M., Graph drawing by force-directed placement (1991) Software: Practice and Experience, 21 (11), pp. 1129-1164; Garfield, E., From the science of science to Scientometrics visualizing the history of science with HistCite software (2009) Journal of Informetrics, 3 (3), pp. 173-179; Huisman, M., van Duijn, M.A.J., Software for social network analysis (2005) Models and Methods in Social Network Analysis, pp. 270-316. , J.

This introduction to the MIS Quarterly Special Issue on Business Intelligence Research first provides a framework that identifies the evolution, applications, and emerging research areas of BI&A. BI&A 1.0, BI&A 2.0, and BI&A 3.0 are defined and described in terms of their key characteristics and capabilities. Current research in BI&A is analyzed and challenges and opportunities associated with BI&A research and education are identified. We also report a bibliometric study of critical BI&A publications, researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade of related academic and industry publications. Finally, the six articles that comprise this special issue are introduced and characterized in terms of the proposed BI&A research framework.",Big data analytics; Business intelligence and analytics; Web 2.0,Big data; Data Analytics; Bibliometric; Business organizations; Industry publications; Key characteristics; Research frameworks; Research topics; Web 2.0; Information analysis,"Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., Toward the next generation of recommender systems: A survey of the state-of - The-art and possible extensions (2005) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, pp. 734-749; Anderson, C., The Long Tail (2004) WIRED Magazine, 12 (10). , http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html; (2012) Columbia U Plans New Institute for Data Sciences, , http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57482466/columbia-u-plans-new-institute-for-data-sciences/, Associated Press July 30 accessed August 3, 2012; Barabási, A., (2003) Linked: How Everything Is Connected To Everything Else and What It Means For Business, Science, and Everyday Life, , New York: Plume; Batagelj, V., Mrvar, A., Pajek: A program for large network analysis (1998) Connections, (21), pp. 47-57; Bettencourt, L.M.A., Cintrón-Arias, A., Kaiser, D.I., Castillo- Chávez, C., The power of a good idea: Quantitative modeling of the spread of ideas from epidemiological models (2006) Physica A, (364), pp. 513-536; Bitterer, A., (2011) Hype Cycle For Business Intelligence, , Gartner, Inc., Stamford, CT; Blei, D.M., Probabilistic Topic Models (2012) Communications of the ACM, 55 (4), pp. 77-84; The current state of business analytics: Where do we go from here?

Its applications range from astronomy to bioinformatics, bibliometrics, and pattern recognition.We propose an approach based on the idea that cluster centers are characterized by a higher density than their neighbors and by a relatively large distance from points with higher densities. This idea forms the basis of a clustering procedure in which the number of clusters arises intuitively, outliers are automatically spotted and excluded fromthe analysis, and clusters are recognized regardless of their shape and of the dimensionality of the space inwhich they are embedded.We demonstrate the power of the algorithm on several test cases.",,"algorithm; cluster analysis; numerical method; outlier; performance assessment; algorithm; article; cluster analysis; priority journal; algorithm; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; factual database; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Cluster Analysis; Databases, Factual; Pattern Recognition, Automated","Xu, R., Wunsch II, D., (2005) IEEE Trans.

We use the probability flow of random walks on a network as a proxy for information flows in the real system and decompose the network into modules by compressing a description of the probability flow. The result is a map that both simplifies and highlights the regularities in the structure and their relationships. We illustrate the method by making a map of scientific communication as captured in the citation patterns of >6,000 journals. We discover a multicentric organization with fields that vary dramatically in size and degree of integration into the network of science. Along the backbone of the network - including physics, chemistry, molecular biology, and medicine - information flows bidirectionally, but the map reveals a directional pattern of citation from the applied fields to the basic sciences. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Bibiometrics; Clustering; Compression; Information theory; Map of science,biology; chemistry; community structure; conference paper; information; medicine; molecular biology; physics; priority journal; probability; science; scientific literature; society; theoretical study; bibliometrics; information science; instrumentation; medical research; methodology; publication; review; science; statistics; Bibliometrics; Biomedical Research; Information Theory; Markov Chains; Periodicals as Topic; Science,"Newman, M.E.J., (2003) SIAM Review, 45, pp. 167-256; Newman, M.E.J., Barabási, A.L., Watts, D.J., (2006) The Structure and Dynamics of Networks, , Princeton Univ Press, Princeton, NJ; Girvan, M., Newman, M.E.J., (2002) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 99, pp. 7821-7826; Palla, G., Derényi, I., Farkas, I., Vicsek, T., (2005) Nature, 435, pp. 814-818; Sales-Pardo, M., Guimerà, R., Moreira, A.A., Amaral, L.A.N., (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 104, p. 15224; Guimerà, R., Amaral, L.A.N., (2005) Nature, 433, pp. 895-900; Tufte, E.R., (2006) Beautiful Evidence, , Graphics, Cheshire, CT; Ziv, E., Middendorf, M., Wiggins, C.H., (2005) Phys Rev E, 71, p. 046117; Donath, W.E., Hoffman, A., (1972) IBM Tech Discl Bull, 15, pp. 938-944; Enright, A.J., Van Dongen, S., Ouzounis, C.A., (2002) Nucleic Acids Res, 30, pp. 1575-1584; Newman, M.E.J., Girvan, M., (2004) Phys Rev E, 69, p. 026113; Eriksen, K.A., Simonsen, I., Maslov, S., Sneppen, K., (2003) Phys Rev Lett, 90, p. 148701; Shannon, C.E., Weaver, W., (1949) The Mathematical Theory of Communication, , Univ of Illinois Press, Champaign, IL; Rissanen, J., (1978) Automatica, 14, pp. 465-471; (2005) Advances in Minimum Description Length: Theory and Applications, , Grünwald P, Myung IJ, Pitt M, eds , MIT Press, London; Rosvall, M., Bergstrom, C.T., (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 104, pp. 7327-7331; Shannon, C.E., (1948) Bell Labs Tech J, 27, pp. 379-423; Huffman, D., (1952) Proc Inst Radio Eng, 40, pp. 1098-1102; Zipf, G.K., (1949) Human Behavior and the Principle of Least Effort: An Introduction to Human Ecology, , Addison-Wesley, Cambridge, MA; Clauset, A., Newman, M.E.J., Moore, C., (2004) Phys Rev E, 70, p. 066111; Wakita, K., Tsurumi, T., (2007) arXiv:cs/0702048; Brin, S., Page, L., (1998) Comp Networks ISDN Sys, 33, pp. 107-117; Newman, M.E.J., (2004) Phys Rev E, 69, p. 066133; Guimerà, R., Sales-Pardo, M., Amaral, L.A.N., (2007) Phys Rev E, 76, p. 036102; Leicht, E.A., Newman, M.E.J., (2007), arXiv:0709.4500; Arenas, A., Duch, J., Fernández, A., Gómez, S., (2007) New J Phys, 9, p. 176; de Solla Price, D.J., (1965) Science, 149, pp. 510-515; Small, H., (1973) J Am Soc Inf Sci, 24, pp. 265-269; Small, H., (1999) J Am Soc Inf Sci, 50, pp. 799-813; Moya-Anegón F, Vargas-Quesada1 B, Herrero-Solana V, Chinchilla-Rodríguez Z, Corera-Álvarez E, Munoz-Fernández FJ (2004) Scientometrics 61:129-145; Shiffrin, R.M., Börner, K., (2004) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 101, pp. 5183-5185; (2004) Journal Citation Reports, , Institute for Scientific Information , Thompson Scientific, Philadelphia, PA","Rosvall, M.; Department of Biology, , Seattle, WA 98195-1800, United States; email: rosvall@u.washington.edu",,,National Academy of Sciences,,,,,00278424,,PNASA,18216267.0,English,Proc.

The relationship between the concepts is not made explicit in literature, which is blurring their conceptual contours and constrains the efficacy of using the approaches in research and practice. This research addresses this gap and aims to provide conceptual clarity by distinguishing the terms and synthesising the different types of relationships between them. We conducted an extensive literature review, employing bibliometric analysis and snowballing techniques to investigate the state of the art in the field and synthesise the similarities, differences and relationships between both terms. We identified eight different relationship types in the literature and illustrated the most evident similarities and differences between both concepts. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Circular business model; Circular Economy; Closed loop; Literature review; Sustainability; Sustainable development,Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Bibliometric analysis; Business modeling; Circular economy; Closed loops; Literature reviews; nocv1; Policy makers; State of the art; Sustainable development,"Acero, L., Savaget, P., Plural understandings of sociotechnical progress within the OECD (2014) 12th Globelics International Conference, 19–31 October 2014, , (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia); Allwood, J.M., Squaring the circular economy: the role of recycling within a hierarchy of material management strategies (2014) Handbook of Recycling: State-of-the-art for Practitioners, Analysts, and Scientists, pp. 445-477. , E.

Recent publications have smaller citation counts because they have had less time to be cited, but this effect is standardized when comparing team versus solo publications within a given year; In patenting, we may observe weaker trends because (i) citing earlier work can limit a patent's scope, so that applicants may avoid citations, and (ii) patent examiners typically add the majority of citations, which makes patent citations different from paper citations (26, 27); A self-citation is defined as any citation where a common name exists in the authorship of both the cited and the citing papers. All citations were removed in which a citing and cited author's first initial and last name matched. This method can also eliminate citations where the authors are different people but share the same name. However, performing Monte Carlo simulations on the data, we find that such errors occur in less than 1 of every 2000 citations. Thus, any errors introduced by this method appear negligible. We did not remove self-citations from patents because citations to previous work in the patent literature are primarily assigned by the patent examiner 27, who independently assigns citations to earlier work based on the relevance of previous patents' content; Kuhn, T.S., (1970) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, , Univ. of Chicago Press, Chicago; Becker, G., Murphy, K., (1992) Q.

This research aimed to develop and test a theory-linked taxonomy of generally applicable behavior change techniques (BCTs). Design: Twenty-six BCTs were defined. Two psychologists used a 5-page coding manual to independently judge the presence or absence of each technique in published intervention descriptions and in intervention manuals. Results: Three systematic reviews yielded 195 published descriptions. Across 78 reliability tests (i.e., 26 techniques applied to 3 reviews), the average kappa per technique was 0.79, with 93% of judgments being agreements. Interventions were found to vary widely in the range and type of techniques used, even when targeting the same behavior among similar participants. The average agreement for intervention manuals was 85%, and a comparison of BCTs identified in 13 manuals and 13 published articles describing the same interventions generated a technique correspondence rate of 74%, with most mismatches (73%) arising from identification of a technique in the manual but not in the article. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the feasibility of developing standardized definitions of BCTs included in behavioral interventions and highlight problematic variability in the reporting of intervention content. © 2008 American Psychological Association.",behavior change; CONSORT; content; intervention; taxonomy; techniques,article; behavior modification; feasibility study; intervention study; psychologist; reliability; taxonomy; Behavior Therapy; Bibliometrics; Health Behavior; Humans; Psychotherapy,"Abraham, C., Southby, L., Quandte, S., Krahé, B., van der Sluijs, W., Identifying research-based persuasive messages in health promotion texts: An analysis of widely available European alcohol-education leaflets (2007) Psychology & Health, 22, pp. 31-60; Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, pp. 179-211; Albarracín, D., Gillette, J.C., Earl, A.N., Glasman, L.R., Durantini, M.R., Ho, M.-H., A test of major assumptions about behavior change: A comprehensive look at the effects of passive and active HIV-prevention interventions since the beginning of the epidemic (2005) Psychological Bulletin, 131, pp. 856-897; Austin, J.T., Vancouver, J.B., Goal constructs in psychology: Structure, process, and content (1996) Psychological Review, 120, pp. 338-375; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy: The exercise of control, , Freeman, NewYork; Bartholomew, L.K., Parcel, G.S., Kok, G., Gottlieb, N.H., (2006) Planning health promotion programs: An intervention mapping approach, , Jossey-Bass, San Francisco; Bellg, A.J., Borrelli, B., Resnick, B., Hecht, J., Minicucci, D.S., Orly, M., Enhancing treatment fidelity on health behavior change studies: Best practices and recommendations from the NIH Behavior Change Consortium (2004) Health Psychology, 23, pp. 443-451; Berkman, L.F., Syme, S.L., Social networks, host resistance and mortality: A nine year follow-up study of Alameda county residents (1979) American Journal of Epidemiology, 109, pp. 186-204; Boyatzis, R.E., (1998) Transforming qualitative information: Thematic analysis and code development, , Sage, London; Carver, C.S., Scheier, M.F., Control theory: A useful conceptual framework for personality-social, clinical and health psychology (1998) Psychological Bulletin, 92, pp. 111-135; Chambless, D.L., Ollendick, T.H., Empirically supported psychological interventions: Controversies and evidence (2001) Annual Review of Psychology, 52, pp. 685-716; Cialdini, R.B., Principles and techniques of social influence (1995) Advanced social psychology, pp. 257-281. , Tesser A.

Versions of this principle have been studied in the hypertext research community and (in a context predating hypermedia) through journal citation analysis in the field of bibliometrics. In this work we develop a set of algorithmic techniques for studying the link structure of hypermedia environments, and we report on experiments that demonstrate their effectiveness in several contexts on the World Wide Web. One issue that our methods address is that of identifying www pages that are `authoritative sources' on broad search topics; this problem arises, for example, when trying to select a high-quality set of relevant `representative pages' from among a large collection of pages retrieved by a text-based search method. We propose and test an algorithmic formulation of the notion of authority, based on a method for locating dense bipartite communities in the link structure. Our formulation has an interesting interpretation in terms of the eigenvectors of certain matrices associated with the link graph; this motivates additional heuristics for clustering and for computing a type of link-based similarity among hyperlinked documents.",,Algorithms; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Graph theory; Heuristic methods; Matrix algebra; World Wide Web; Hyperlinked environment; Hypermedia systems,,"Kleinberg, Jon M.; Cornell Univ, Ithaca, United States",Anon,ACM,"SIAM, Philadelphia, PA, United States",Proceedings of the 1998 9th Annual ACM SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms,25 January 1998 through 27 January 1998,"San Francisco, CA, USA",49974.0,,,PAAAF,,English,Proc Annu ACM SIAM Symp Discrete Algorithms,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032256758

It differs from the Negative Binomial Distribution in that lack of success, being a non‐event, is not punished by increased chance of failure. It is shown that such a stochastic law is governed by the Beta Function, containing only one free parameter, and this is approximated by a skew or hyperbolic distribution of the type that is widespread in bibliometrics and diverse social science phenomena. In particular, this is shown to be an appropriate underlying probabilistic theory for the Bradford Law, the Lotka Law, the Pareto and Zipf Distributions, and for all the empirical results of citation frequency analysis. As side results one may derive also the obsolescence factor for literature use. The Beta Function is peculiarly elegant for these manifold purposes because it yields both the actual and the cumulative distributions in simple form, and contains a limiting case of an inverse square law to which many empirical distributions conform.

It is particularly suitable for science mapping at a time when the emphasis on empirical contributions is producing voluminous, fragmented, and controversial research streams. Science mapping is complex and unwieldly because it is multi-step and frequently requires numerous and diverse software tools, which are not all necessarily freeware. Although automated workflows that integrate these software tools into an organized data flow are emerging, in this paper we propose a unique open-source tool, designed by the authors, called bibliometrix, for performing comprehensive science mapping analysis. bibliometrix supports a recommended workflow to perform bibliometric analyses. As it is programmed in R, the proposed tool is flexible and can be rapidly upgraded and integrated with other statistical R-packages. It is therefore useful in a constantly changing science such as bibliometrics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Bibliographic coupling; Bibliometrics; Co-citation; R package; Science mapping; Workflow,Computer software; Data flow analysis; Open source software; Open systems; Bibliographic couplings; Bibliometric analysis; Bibliometrics; Cocitation; Mapping analysis; Open source tools; Work-flows; Workflow; Mapping,"Alavifard, S., hindexcalculator: H-index calculator using data from a web of science (WoS) citation report.

Controversies are most prominent when high-impact research is involved. Objectives: To understand how frequently highly cited studies are contradicted or find effects that are stronger than in other similar studies and to discern whether specific characteristics are associated with such refutation over time. Design: All original clinical research studies published in 3 major general clinical journals or high-impact-factor specialty journals in 1990-2003 and cited more than 1000 times in the literature were examined. Main Outcome Measure: The results of highly cited articles were compared against subsequent studies of comparable or larger sample size and similar or better controlled designs. The same analysis was also performed comparatively for matched studies that were not so highly cited. Results: Of 49 highly cited original clinical research studies, 45 claimed that the intervention was effective. Of these, 7 (16%) were contradicted by subsequent studies, 7 others (16%) had found effects that were stronger than those of subsequent studies, 20 (44%) were replicated, and 11 (24%) remained largely unchallenged. Five of 6 highly-cited nonrandomized studies had been contradicted or had found stronger effects vs 9 of 39 randomized controlled trials (P=.008). Among randomized trials, studies with contradicted or stronger effects were smaller (P=.009) than replicated or unchallenged studies although there was no statistically significant difference in their early or overall citation impact. Matched control studies did not have a significantly different share of refuted results than highly cited studies, but they included more studies with ""negative"" results. Conclusions: Contradiction and initially stronger effects are not unusual in highly cited research of clinical interventions and their outcomes. The extent to which high citations may provoke contradictions and vice versa needs more study. Controversies are most common with highly cited nonrandomized studies, but even the most highly cited randomized trials may be challenged and refuted over time, especially small ones. ©2005 American Medical Association.

Most bibliometric analyses have in common their data sources: Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science (WoS) and Elsevier’s Scopus. The objective of this research is to describe the journal coverage of those two databases and to assess whether some field, publishing country and language are over or underrepresented. To do this we compared the coverage of active scholarly journals in WoS (13,605 journals) and Scopus (20,346 journals) with Ulrich’s extensive periodical directory (63,013 journals). Results indicate that the use of either WoS or Scopus for research evaluation may introduce biases that favor Natural Sciences and Engineering as well as Biomedical Research to the detriment of Social Sciences and Arts and Humanities. Similarly, English-language journals are overrepresented to the detriment of other languages. While both databases share these biases, their coverage differs substantially. As a consequence, the results of bibliometric analyses may vary depending on the database used. These results imply that in the context of comparative research evaluation, WoS and Scopus should be used with caution, especially when comparing different fields, institutions, countries or languages. The bibliometric community should continue its efforts to develop methods and indicators that include scientific output that are not covered in WoS or Scopus, such as field-specific and national citation indexes. © 2015, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Bibliometrics; Citation indexes; Research evaluation; Scopus; Web of Science,,"Abrizah, A., Zainab, A.N., Kiran, K., Raj, R.G., LIS journals scientific impact and subject categorization: A comparison between Web of Science and Scopus (2012) Scientometrics, 94 (2), pp. 721-740; Archambault, É., Campbell, D., Gingras, Y., Larivière, V., Comparing bibliometric statistics obtained from the Web of Science and Scopus (2009) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 60 (7), pp. 1320-1326; Archambault, É., Vignola-Gagné, É., Côté, G., Larivière, V., Gingras, Y., Benchmarking scientific output in the social sciences and humanities: The limits of existing databases (2006) Scientometrics, 68 (3), pp. 329-342; Barnett, P., Lascar, C., Comparing unique title coverage of Web of Science and Scopus in Earth and atmospheric sciences (2012) Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship; Clermont, M., Dyckhoff, H., Coverage of business administration literature in Google Scholar: Analysis and comparison with Econbiz, Scopus and Web of Science (SSRN Scholarly Paper No (2012) ID 2016850), , http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2016850, Rochester, NY: Social Science Research Network.

It is a relatively new approach for which a universal study definition or definitive procedure has not been established. The purpose of this scoping review was to provide an overview of scoping reviews in the literature. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. A search was conducted in four bibliographic databases and the gray literature to identify scoping review studies. Review selection and characterization were performed by two independent reviewers using pretested forms. Results: The search identified 344 scoping reviews published from 1999 to October 2012. The reviews varied in terms of purpose, methodology, and detail of reporting. Nearly three-quarter of reviews (74.1%) addressed a health topic. Study completion times varied from 2weeks to 20months, and 51% utilized a published methodological framework. Quality assessment of included studies was infrequently performed (22.38%). Conclusions: Scoping reviews are a relatively new but increasingly common approach for mapping broad topics. Because of variability in their conduct, there is a need for their methodological standardization to ensure the utility and strength of evidence. © 2014 The Authors.

Such methods introduce a measure of objectivity into the evaluation of scientific literature and hold the potential to increase rigor and mitigate researcher bias in reviews of scientific literature by aggregating the opinions of multiple scholars working in the field. We introduce the bibliometric methods of citation analysis, co-citation analysis, bibliographical coupling, co-author analysis, and co-word analysis and present a workflow for conducting bibliometric studies with guidelines for researchers. We envision that bibliometric methods will complement meta-analysis and qualitative structured literature reviews as a method for reviewing and evaluating scientific literature. To demonstrate bibliometric methods, we performed a citation and co-citation analysis to map the intellectual structure of the Organizational Research Methods journal. © The Author(s) 2014",bibliographic coupling; bibliometrics; co-citation; science mapping,,"Acedo, F.J., Barroso, C., Casanueva, C., Galan, J.L., Co-authorship in management and organizational studies: An empirical and network analysis (2006) Journal of Management Studies, 43 (5), pp. 957-983; Acedo, F.J., Barroso, C., Galan, J.L., The resource-based theory: Dissemination and main trends (2006) Strategic Management Journal, 27 (7), pp. 621-636; Acedo, F.J., Casillas, J.C., Current paradigms in the international management field: An author co-citation analysis (2005) International Business Review, 14 (5), pp. 619-639; Aguinis, H., Pierce, C.A., Bosco, F.A., Dalton, D.R., Dalton, C.M., Debunking myths and urban legends about meta-analysis (2011) Organizational Research Methods, 14 (2), pp. 306-331; Aguinis, H., Pierce, C.A., Bosco, F.A., Muslin, I.S., First decade of Organizational Research Methods: Trends in design, measurement, and data-analysis topics (2009) Organizational Research Methods, 12 (1), pp. 69-112; Ahlgren, P., Jarneving, B., Rousseau, R., Requirements for a cocitation similarity measure, with special reference to Pearson’s correlation coefficient (2003) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 54 (6), pp. 550-560; Artto, K., Martinsuo, M., Gemuendne, H.G., Murtoaro, J., Foundations of program management: A bibliometric view (2009) International Journal of Project Management, 27 (1), pp. 1-18; Backhaus, K., Luegger, K., Koch, M., The structure and evolution of business-to-business marketing: A citation and co-citation analysis (2011) Industrial Marketing Management, 40 (6, SI), pp. 940-951; Batagelj, V., Mrvar, A., PajekPprogram for large network analysis (1998) Connections, 21 (2), pp. 47-57; Baumgartner, H., Bibliometric reflections on the history of consumer research (2010) Journal of Consumer Psychology, 20 (3), pp. 233-238; Benavides-Velasco, C.A., Quintana-García, C., Guzmán-Parra, V.F., Trends in family business research (2011) Small Business Economics, 40 (1), pp. 41-57; Bernroider, E.W., Pilkington, A., Córdoba, J.-R., Research in information systems: A study of diversity and inter-disciplinary discourse in the AIS basket journals between 1995 and 2011 (2013) Journal of Information Technology, 28 (1), pp. 74-89; Bhupatiraju, S., Nomaler, Triulzi, G., Verspagen, B., Knowledge flows—Analyzing the core literature of innovation, entrepreneurship and science and technology studies (2012) Research Policy, 41 (7), pp. 1205-1218; Biemans, W., Griffin, A., Moenaert, R., Twenty years of the Journal of Product Innovation Management: History, participants, and knowledge stock and flows (2007) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 24 (3), pp. 193-213; Blei, D.M., Probabilistic topic models (2012) Communications of the ACM, 55 (4), pp. 77-84; Blondel, V.D., Guillaume, J.-L., Lambiotte, R., Lefebvre, E., Fast unfolding of communities in large networks (2008) Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment, 2008 (10), p.

The result is an understanding of psychology that is incomplete and does not adequately represent humanity. First, an analysis of articles published in six premier APA journals is presented, showing that the contributors, samples, and editorial leadership of the journals are predominantly American. Then, a demographic profile of the human population is presented to show that the majority of the world's population lives in conditions vastly different from the conditions of Americans, underlining doubts of how well American psychological research can be said to represent humanity. The reasons for the narrowness of American psychological research are examined, with a focus on a philosophy of science that emphasizes fundamental processes and ignores or strips away cultural context. Finally, several suggestions for broadening the scope of American psychology are offered. © 2008 American Psychological Association.",cultural psychology; international; philosophy of science; second psychology; universals,article; bibliometrics; demography; epidemiology; health; human; international cooperation; psychology; research; United States; Bibliometrics; Demography; Humans; Internationality; Psychology; Research; Selection Bias; United States; World Health,"Adair, J.G., Coelho, A.E.L., Luna, J.R., How international is psychology?

Commonly used propensity-score methods include covariate adjustment using the propensity score, stratification on the propensity score, and propensity-score matching. Empirical and theoretical research has demonstrated that matching on the propensity score eliminates a greater proportion of baseline differences between treated and untreated subjects than does stratification on the propensity score. However, the analysis of propensity-score-matched samples requires statistical methods appropriate for matched-pairs data. We critically evaluated 47 articles that were published between 1996 and 2003 in the medical literature and that employed propensity-score matching. We found that only two of the articles reported the balance of baseline characteristics between treated and untreated subjects in the matched sample and used correct statistical methods to assess the degree of imbalance. Thirteen (28 per cent) of the articles explicitly used statistical methods appropriate for the analysis of matched data when estimating the treatment effect and its statistical significance. Common errors included using the log-rank test to compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves in the matched sample, using Cox regression, logistic regression, chi-squared tests, t-tests, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests in the matched sample, thereby failing to account for the matched nature of the data. We provide guidelines for the analysis and reporting of studies that employ propensity-score matching.

Resilience has become an important goal for cities, particularly in the face of climate change. Urban areas house the majority of the world's population, and, in addition to functioning as nodes of resource consumption and as sites for innovation, have become laboratories for resilience, both in theory and in practice. This paper reviews the scholarly literature on urban resilience and concludes that the term has not been well defined. Existing definitions are inconsistent and underdeveloped with respect to incorporation of crucial concepts found in both resilience theory and urban theory. Based on this literature review, and aided by bibliometric analysis, the paper identifies six conceptual tensions fundamental to urban resilience: (1) definition of 'urban'; (2) understanding of system equilibrium; (3) positive vs. neutral (or negative) conceptualizations of resilience; (4) mechanisms for system change; (5) adaptation versus general adaptability; and (6) timescale of action. To advance this burgeoning field, more conceptual clarity is needed. This paper, therefore, proposes a new definition of urban resilience. This definition takes explicit positions on these tensions, but remains inclusive and flexible enough to enable uptake by, and collaboration among, varying disciplines. The paper concludes with a discussion of how the definition might serve as a boundary object, with the acknowledgement that applying resilience in different contexts requires answering: Resilience for whom and to what? When? Where? And why?. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Adaptation; Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Resilient cities; Socio-ecological systems; Urban resilience,Climate change; Decision making; Adaptation; Adaptive capacity; Resilient cities; Socio-ecological systems; Urban resilience; Urban growth; adaptive management; climate change; literature review; theoretical study; urban housing; urban planning,"Adger, W.N., Social and ecological resilience: Are they related?

Based on the results of these studies, the paper seeks to answer the question of the extent to which scientists are motivated to cite a publication not only to acknowledge intellectual and cognitive influences of scientific peers, but also for other, possibly non-scientific, reasons. Design/methodology/approach - The review covers research published from the early 1960s up to mid-2005 (approximately 30 studies on citing behavior-reporting results in about 40 publications). Findings - The general tendency of the results of the empirical studies makes it clear that citing behavior is not motivated solely by the wish to acknowledge intellectual and cognitive influences of colleague scientists, since the individual studies reveal also other, in part non-scientific, factors that play a part in the decision to cite. However, the results of the studies must also be deemed scarcely reliable: the studies vary widely in design, and their results can hardly be replicated. Many of the studies have methodological weaknesses. Furthermore, there is evidence that the different motivations of citers are ""not so different or 'randomly given' to such an extent that the phenomenon of citation would lose its role as a reliable measure of impact"". Originality/value - Given the increasing importance of evaluative bibliometrics in the world of scholarship, the question ""What do citation counts measure?"" is a particularly relevant and topical issue. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Bibliographic systems; Reference services,,"Abt, H.A., Institutional productivities (1993) Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 105, pp. 794-8; Ahmed, T., Johnson, B., Oppenheim, C., Peck, C., Highly cited old papers and the reasons why they continue to be cited: Part II. the 1953 Watson and Crick article on the structure of DNA (2004) Scientometrics, 61, pp. 147-56; Aksnes, D.W., Taxt, R.E., Peer reviews and bibliometric indicators: A comparative study at a Norwegian university (2004) Research Evaluation, 13, pp. 33-41; Psychological Association, A., (2004) Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, , American Psychological Association (APA) Washington, DC; Anderson, A., First scientific fraud conviction (1988) Nature, 335, p. 389; Anderson, R.C., Narin, F., McAllister, P., Publication ratings versus peer ratings of universities (1978) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 29, pp. 91-103; Archambault, E., Gagné, E.-V., Cté, G., Larivière, V., Gingras, Y., Welcome to the linguistic warp zone: Benchmarking scientific output in the social sciences and humanities (2005) Proceedings of the 10th International Conference of the International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics, , Ingwersen, P.

A number of literature reviews have been published focusing on specific aspects of green supply chain management such as performance measurement, supplier selection/evaluation, analytical modeling efforts, and some others with broader areas of focus. This paper presents a thorough bibliometric and network analysis that provides insights not previously fully grasped or evaluated by other reviews on this topic. The analysis begins by identifying over 1000 published studies, which are then distilled down to works of proven influence and those authored by influential investigators. Using rigorous bibliometric tools, established and emergent research clusters are identified for topological analysis, identification of key research topics, interrelations, and collaboration patterns. This systematic mapping of the field helps graphically illustrate the publications evolution over time and identify areas of current research interests and potential directions for future research. The findings provide a robust roadmap for further investigation in this field. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Bibliometrics; Environmental sustainability; Green supply chain; Literature review; Network analysis,Electric network analysis; Publishing; Sustainable development; Topology; Bibliometric analysis; Bibliometrics; Collaboration patterns; Environmental sustainability; Green supply chain; Green supply chain management; Literature reviews; Performance measurements; Supply chain management,"Abdallah, T., Farhat, A., Diabat, A., Kennedy, S., Green supply chains with carbon trading and environmental sourcing: Formulation and life cycle assessment (2012) Appl.

Twenty years after the Cohen and Levinthal 1990 paper, the field is characterized by a wide array of theoretical perspectives and a wealth of empirical evidence. In this paper, we first review these underlying theories and empirical studies of absorptive capacity. Given the size and diversity of the absorptive capacity literature, we subsequently map the existing terrain of research through a bibliometric analysis. The resulting bibliometric cartography shows the major discrepancies in the organization field, namely that (1) most attention so far has been focused on the tangible outcomes of absorptive capacity; (2) organizational design and individual level antecedents have been relatively neglected in the absorptive capacity literature; and (3) the emergence of absorptive capacity from the actions and interactions of individual, organizational, and interorganizational antecedents remains unclear. Building on the bibliometric analysis, we develop an integrative model that identifies the multilevel antecedents, process dimensions, and outcomes of absorptive capacity as well as the contextual factors that affect absorptive capacity. We argue that realizing the potential of the absorptive capacity concept requires more research that shows how ""micro-antecedents"" and ""macro-antecedents"" influence future outcomes such as competitive advantage, innovation, and firm performance. In particular, we identify conceptual gaps that may guide future research to fully exploit the absorptive capacity concept in the organization field and to explore future fruitful extensions of the concept. © 2010 INFORMS.",Absorptive capacity; Knowledge management; Microfoundations of absorptive capacity; Multiple analytical levels; Organizational capabilities,,"Adner, R., Helfat, C.E., Corporate effects and dynamic managerial capabilities (2003) Strategic Management J., 24, pp. 1011-1025; Ahuja, G., The duality of collaboration: Inducements and opportunities in the formation of interfirm linkages (2000) Strategic Management J., 21 (3), pp. 317-343; Ahuja, G., Lampert, C.M., Entrepreneurship in the large corporation: A longitudinal study of how established firms create breakthrough inventions (2001) Strategic Management J., 22, pp. 521-543; Andersen, T.J., Foss, N.J., Strategic opportunity and economic performance in multinational enterprises: The role and effects of information and communication technology (2005) J.

In such cases, the use of bibliometrics and patent analysis have provided useful data. This paper presents the forecasts for three emerging technology areas by integrating the use of bibliometrics and patent analysis into well-known technology forecasting tools such as scenario planning, growth curves and analogies. System dynamics is also used to be able to model the dynamic ecosystem of the technologies and their diffusion. Technologies being forecasted are fuel cell, food safety and optical storage technologies. Results from these three applications help us to validate the proposed methods as appropriate tools to forecast emerging technologies. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

These sources include methodological differences between studies, as well as demographic or clinical differences between depressed samples. Methods: The current study used meta-analytic techniques to compare 671 effect sizes (cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, or corticotropin-releasing hormone) across 361 studies, including 18,454 individuals. Results: Although depressed individuals tended to display increased cortisol (d = 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.66) and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels (d = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.16-0.41), they did not display elevations in corticotropin-releasing hormone (d = 0.02; 95% CI, -0.47-0.51). The magnitude of the cortisol effect was reduced by almost half (d = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.21-0.45) when analyses were limited to studies that met minimal methodological standards. Gender did not significantly modify any HPA outcome. Studies that included older hospitalized individuals reported significantly greater cortisol differences between depressed and nondepressed groups compared with studies with younger outpatient samples. Important cortisol differences also emerged for atypical, endogenous, melancholic, and psychotic forms of depression. Conclusions: The current study suggests that the degree of HPA hyperactivity can vary considerably across patient groups. Results are consistent with HPA hyperactivity as a link between depression and increased risk for conditions, such as diabetes, dementia, coronary heart disease, and osteoporosis. Such a link is strongest among older inpatients who display melancholic or psychotic features of depression.

The nature and magnitude of collaboration vary from one discipline to another, and depend upon such factors as the nature of the research problem, the research environ ment, and demographic factors. Earlier studies have shown a high degree of correlation between collaboration and research productivity, and between collaboration and financial support for research. The extent of collaboration cannot be easily determined by traditional methods of survey and observation. Bibliometric methods offer a convenient and non-reactive tool for studying collaboration in research. In this paper, several types of collaboration have been identified, and earlier research on collaboration has been reviewed. Further research is needed to refine the methods of defining and assessing collaboration and its impact on the organization of research and communication in science. © 1983, Sage Publications.

Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic scientific evidence that altmetrics are valid proxies of either impact or utility although a few case studies have reported medium correlations between specific altmetrics and citation rates for individual journals or fields. To fill this gap, this study compares 11 altmetrics with Web of Science citations for 76 to 208,739 PubMed articles with at least one altmetric mention in each case and up to 1,891 journals per metric. It also introduces a simple sign test to overcome biases caused by different citation and usage windows. Statistically significant associations were found between higher metric scores and higher citations for articles with positive altmetric scores in all cases with sufficient evidence (Twitter, Facebook wall posts, research highlights, blogs, mainstream media and forums) except perhaps for Google+ posts. Evidence was insufficient for LinkedIn, Pinterest, question and answer sites, and Reddit, and no conclusions should be drawn about articles with zero altmetric scores or the strength of any correlation between altmetrics and citations. Nevertheless, comparisons between citations and metric values for articles published at different times, even within the same year, can remove or reverse this association and so publishers and scientometricians should consider the effect of time when using altmetrics to rank articles. Finally, the coverage of all the altmetrics except for Twitter seems to be low and so it is not clear if they are prevalent enough to be useful in practice. © 2013 Thelwall et al.",,access to information; altmetric measurement; article; citation analysis; controlled study; information processing; journal impact factor; mass communication; medical research; multimedia; online system; scientific literature; social network; web browser; Bibliometrics; Humans; Publishing; PubMed; Social Media,"Priem, J., Hemminger, B.M., Scientometrics 2.0: Toward new metrics of scholarly impact on the social web (2010) First Monday, 15. , http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2874/257, Available:.

In this study, we reexamine the question of the growth of science. To do this we (a) use current data up to publication year 2012 and (b) analyze the data across all disciplines and also separately for the natural sciences and for the medical and health sciences. Furthermore, the data were analyzed with an advanced statistical technique - segmented regression analysis - which can identify specific segments with similar growth rates in the history of science. The study is based on two different sets of bibliometric data: (a) the number of publications held as source items in the Web of Science (WoS, Thomson Reuters) per publication year and (b) the number of cited references in the publications of the source items per cited reference year. We looked at the rate at which science has grown since the mid-1600s. In our analysis of cited references we identified three essential growth phases in the development of science, which each led to growth rates tripling in comparison with the previous phase: from less than 1% up to the middle of the 18th century, to 2 to 3% up to the period between the two world wars, and 8 to 9% to 2010. © 2015 ASIS&T.",bibliometrics,Growth rate; Information science; Regression analysis; Bibliometric analysis; Bibliometrics; Growth of science; History of science; Segmented regressions; Specific segments; Statistical techniques; Web of Science; Publishing; growth curve; growth rate; health science; natural science; publication; regression analysis; Web of Science,"Bornmann, L., Scientific peer review (2011) Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 45, pp. 199-245; Bornmann, L., Measuring the societal impact of research (2012) EMBO Reports, 13 (8), pp. 673-676; Bornmann, L., What is societal impact of research and how can it be assessed?

Based on a sample of 146 senior academics in five broad disciplinary areas, we therefore provide both a longitudinal and a cross-disciplinary comparison of the three databases. Our longitudinal comparison of eight data points between 2013 and 2015 shows a consistent and reasonably stable quarterly growth for both publications and citations across the three databases. This suggests that all three databases provide sufficient stability of coverage to be used for more detailed cross-disciplinary comparisons. Our cross-disciplinary comparison of the three databases includes four key research metrics (publications, citations, h-index, and hI, annual, an annualised individual h-index) and five major disciplines (Humanities, Social Sciences, Engineering, Sciences and Life Sciences). We show that both the data source and the specific metrics used change the conclusions that can be drawn from cross-disciplinary comparisons. © 2015, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Citation analysis; Google Scholar; H-index; hIa; Research metrics; Scopus; Web of Science,,"Adler, N., Harzing, A.W., When knowledge wins: Transcending the sense and nonsense of academic rankings (2009) The Academy of Management Learning & Education, 8 (1), pp. 72-95; Adriaanse, L.S., Rensleigh, C., Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar: A content comprehensiveness comparison (2013) The Electronic Library, 31 (6), pp. 727-744; Amara, N., Landry, R., Counting citations in the field of business and management: Why use Google Scholar rather than the Web of Science (2012) Scientometrics, 93 (3), pp. 553-581; Bakkalbasi, N., Bauer, K., Glover, J., Wang, L., Three options for citation tracking: Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science (2006) Biomedical digital libraries, 3 (1), p. 7; Bar-Ilan, J., Citations to the “Introduction to informetrics” indexed by WOS (2010) Scopus and Google Scholar.

Advancement is largely driven by peer-reviewed original research, so we sought to determine the representation of female physician-investigators among the authors of selected publications during the past 35 years. Methods: Original articles from six prominent medical journals - the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), the Annals of Internal Medicine (Ann Intern Med), the Annals of Surgery (Ann Surg), Obstetrics & Gynecology (Obstet Gynecol), and the Journal of Pediatrics (J Pediatr) - were categorized according to the sex of both the first and the senior (last listed) author. Sex was also determined for the authors of guest editorials in NEJM and JAMA. Data were collected for the years 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2004. The analysis was restricted to authors from U.S. institutions holding M.D. degrees. Results: The sex was determined for 98.5 percent of the 7249 U.S. authors of original research with M.D. degrees. The proportion of first authors who were women increased from 5.9 percent in 1970 to 29.3 percent in 2004 (P<0.001), and the proportion of senior authors who were women increased from 3.7 percent to 19.3 percent (P<0.001) during the same period. The proportion of authors who were women increased most sharply in Obstet Gynecol (from 6.7 percent of first authors and 6.8 percent of senior authors in 1970 to 40.7 percent of first authors and 28.0 percent of senior authors in 2004) and J Pediatr (from 15.0 percent of first authors and 4.3 percent of senior authors in 1970 to 38.9 percent of first authors and 38.0 percent of senior authors in 2004) and remained low in Ann Surg (from 2.3 percent of first authors and 0.7 percent of senior authors in 1970 to 16.7 percent of first authors and 6.7 percent of senior authors in 2004). In 2004, 11.4 percent of the authors of guest editorials in NEJM and 18.8 percent of the authors of guest editorials in JAMA were women. Conclusions: Over the past four decades, the proportion of women among both first and senior physician-authors of original research in the United States has significantly increased. Nevertheless, women still compose a minority of the authors of original research and guest editorials in the journals studied.

This approach combines performance analysis and science mapping for detecting and visualizing conceptual subdomains (particular themes or general thematic areas). It allows us to quantify and visualize the thematic evolution of a given research field. To do this, co-word analysis is used in a longitudinal framework in order to detect the different themes treated by the research field across the given time period. The performance analysis uses different bibliometric measures, including the h-index, with the purpose of measuring the impact of both the detected themes and thematic areas. The presented approach includes a visualization method for showing the thematic evolution of the studied field.Then, as an example, the thematic evolution of the Fuzzy Sets Theory field is analyzed using the two most important journals in the topic: Fuzzy Sets and Systems and IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Bibliometric studies; Co-word analysis; Fuzzy Sets Theory; H-Index; Science mapping; Thematic evolution,,"Alonso, S., Cabrerizo, F., Herrera-Viedma, E., Herrera, F., H-Index: A review focused in its variants, computation and standardization for different scientific fields (2009) Journal of Informetrics, 3, pp. 273-289; Bailón-Moreno, R., Jurado-Alameda, E., Ruiz-Banos, R., Courtial, J., Analysis of the scientific field of physical chemistry of surfactants with the unified scienctometric model.

Main differences in publication and citation behavior between the (basic) sciences and the social sciences and humanities are outlined. Limitations of the (S)SCI and A&HCI for monitoring research performance are considered. For research performance monitoring in many social sciences and humanities, the methods used in science need to be extended. A broader range of both publications (including non-ISI journals and monographs) and citation indicators (including non-ISI reference citation values) is needed. Three options for bibliometric monitoring are discussed.",,,"Adair, J.G., Vohra, N., The explosion of knowledge, references, and citations.

Many different indicators have been developed in order to extend and overcome the drawbacks of the original Hirsch proposal. In this contribution we present a comprehensive review on the h-index and related indicators field. From the initial h-index proposal we study their main advantages, drawbacks and the main applications that we can find in the literature. A description of many of the h-related indices that have been developed along with their main characteristics and some of the works that analyze and compare them are presented. We also review the most up to date standardization studies that allow a fair comparison by means of the h-index among scientists from different research areas and finally, some works that analyze the computation of the h-index and related indices by using different citation databases (ISI Citation Indexes, Google Scholar and Scopus) are introduced. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Data Sources and Study Selection: MEDLINE via PubMed was searched for reports of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 3 medical areas (cardiology, rheumatology, and gastroenterology) indexed in 2008 in the 10 general medical journals and specialty journals with the highest impact factors. Data Extraction: For each included article, we obtained the trial registration information using a standardized data extraction form. Results: Of the 323 included trials, 147 (45.5%) were adequately registered (ie, registered before the end of the trial, with the primary outcome clearly specified). Trial registration was lacking for 89 published reports (27.6%), 45 trials (13.9%) were registered after the completion of the study, 35 (10.8%) were registered with no or an unclear description of the primary outcome, 39 (12%) were registered with no or an unclear description of the primary outcome, and 3 (0.9%) were registered after the completion of the study and had an unclear description of the primary outcome. Among articles with trials adequately registered, 31% (46 of 147) showed some evidence of discrepancies between the outcomes registered and the outcomes published. The influence of these discrepancies could be assessed in only half of them and in these statistically significant results were favored in 82.6% (19 of 23). Conclusion: Comparison of the primary outcomes of RCTs registered with their subsequent publication indicated that selective outcome reporting is prevalent. ©2009 American Medical Association.

We show that the probability that an article is cited c times has large variations between different disciplines, but all distributions are rescaled on a universal curve when the relative indicator cf = c/c0 is considered, where c0 is the average number of citations per article for the discipline. In addition we show that the same universal behavior occurs when citation distributions of articles published in the same field, but in different years, are compared. These findings provide a strong validation of c f as an unbiased indicator for citation performance across disciplines and years. Based on this indicator, we introduce a generalization of the h index suitable for comparing scientists working in different fields. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Analysis; Bibliometrics; H index,"article; bibliometrics; citation analysis; mathematical model; medical research; priority journal; scientific literature; Interdisciplinary Communication; Journal Impact Factor; Models, Theoretical; Selection Bias","Hirsch, J.E., An index to quantify an individual's scientific research output (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 102, pp. 16569-16572; Egghe, L., Theory and practise of the g-index (2006) Scientometrics, 69, pp. 131-152; Hirsch, J.E., Does the h index have predictive power?

This was a longitudinal bibliometric analysis of a cohort of OA and non-OA articles published between June 8, 2004, and December 20, 2004, in the same journal (PNAS: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences). Article characteristics were extracted, and citation data were compared between the two groups at three different points in time: at ""quasi-baseline"" (December 2004, 0-6 mo after publication), in April 2005 (4-10 mo after publication), and in October 2005 (10-16 mo after publication). Potentially confounding variables, including number of authors, authors' lifetime publication count and impact, submission track, country of corresponding author, funding organization, and discipline, were adjusted for in logistic and linear multiple regression models. A total of 1,492 original research articles were analyzed: 212 (14.2% of all articles) were OA articles paid by the author, and 1,280 (85.8%) were non-OA articles. In April 2005 (mean 206 d after publication), 627 (49.0%) of the non-OA articles versus 78 (36.8%) of the OA articles were not cited (relative risk = 1.3 [95% Confidence Interval: 1.1-1.6]; p = 0.001). 6 mo later (mean 288 d after publication), non-OA articles were still more likely to be uncited (non-OA: 172 [13.6%], OA: 11 [5.2%]; relative risk = 2.6 [1.4-4.7]; p < 0.001). The average number of citations of OA articles was higher compared to non-OA articles (April 2005: 1.5 [SD = 2.5] versus 1.2 [SD = 2.0]; Z = 3.123; p = 0.002; October 2005: 6.4 [SD = 10.4] versus 4.5 [SD = 4.9]; Z = 4.058; p < 0.001). In a logistic regression model, controlling for potential confounders, OA articles compared to non-OA articles remained twice as likely to be cited (odds ratio = 2.1 [1.5-2.9]) in the first 4-10 mo after publication (April 2005), with the odds ratio increasing to 2.9 (1.5-5.5) 10-16 mo after publication (October 2005). Articles published as an immediate OA article on the journal site have higher impact than self-archived or otherwise openly accessible OA articles. We found strong evidence that, even in a journal that is widely available in research libraries, OA articles are more immediately recognized and cited by peers than non-OA articles published in the same journal.

The problem, however, is not the ranking as such. The indicators used for ranking are often not advanced enough, and this situation is part of the broader problem of the application of insufficiently developed bibliometric indicators used by persons who do not have clear competence and experience in the field of quantitative studies of science. After a brief overview of the basic elements of bibliometric analysis, I discuss the major technical and methodological problems in the application of publication and citation data in the context of evaluation. Then I contend that the core of the problem lies not necessarily at the side of the data producer. Quite often persons responsible for research performance evaluation, for instance scientists themselves in their role as head of institutions and departments, science administrators at the government level and other policy makers show an attitude that encourages 'quick and dirty' bibliometric analyses whereas better quality is available. Finally, the necessary conditions for a successful application of advanced bibliometric indicators as support tool for peer review are discussed. Copyright © 2005 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.

Roadmaps are employed as decision aids to improve coordination of activities and resources in increasingly complex and uncertain environments. Specific uses of roadmaps include: S&T management including strategy, planning, executing, reviewing, and transitioning; S&T marketing; enhancing communications among researchers, technologists, product managers, suppliers, users, and other stakeholders; identifying gaps and opportunities in S&T programs; and identifying obstacles to rapid and low-cost product development. S&T managers also use roadmaps to help identify those S&T areas that have high potential promise, and to accelerate the transfer of the S&T to eventual products. However, there has been little attention paid to the practice of roadmapping in the published literature. This paper is a first attempt to bring some common definition to roadmapping practices and display the underlying unity of seemingly fragmented roadmap approaches. The paper begins with generic roadmap definitions, including a taxonomy of roadmaps that attempts to better classify and unify the broad spectrum of roadmap objectives and uses. Characteristics of retrospective and prospective roadmaps are then identified and analyzed, as well as summary characteristics of bibliometric-based S&T mapping techniques. The roadmap construction process, including fundamental principles for constructing high-quality roadmaps, is presented in detail.",Bibliometrics; Citation; Co-citation; Co-occurrence; Co-word; Decision aids; Patent citation; Retrospective analyses; Roadmapping; Roadmaps; Science and technology; Technology insertion; Technology strategy; Technology transfer,Computer applications; Decision making; Managers; Marketing; Product development; Resource allocation; Strategic planning; Technology transfer; Bibliometrics; Citation; Decision aids; Roadmaps; Science and technology; Technology insertion; Technology strategy; Management science,"Albright, R.E., Roadmaps and roadmapping for commercial applications Proc.

Res./Devmt., United States","Objectives: To analyze sources searched in Cochrane reviews, to determine the proportion of trials included in reviews that are indexed in major databases, and to compare the quality of these trials with those from other sources. Methods: All new systematic reviews in the Cochrane Library, Issue1 2001, that were restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs were selected. The sources searched in the reviews were recorded, and the trials included were checked to see whether they were indexed in four major databases. Trials not indexed were checked to determine how they could be identified. The quality of trials found in major databases was compared with those found from other sources. Results: The range in the number of databases searched per review ranged between one and twenty-seven. The proportion of the trials in the four databases were Cochrane Controlled Trials Register= 78.5%, MEDLINE = 68.8%, Embase = 65.0%, and Science/Social Sciences Citation Index = 60.7%. Searching another twenty-six databases after Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), MEDLINE, and Embase only found 2.4% additional trials. There was no significant difference between trials found in the CCTR, MEDLINE, and Embase compared with other trials, with respect to adequate allocation concealment or sample size. Conclusions: There was a large variation between reviews in the exhaustiveness of the literature searches. CCTR was the single best source of RCTs. Additional database searching retrieved only a small percentage of extra trials. Contacting authors and manufacturers to find unpublished trials appeared to be a more effective method of obtaining the additional better quality trials.","Databases, Bibliographic; Meta-analysis; Technology assessment, Biomedical","Randomized controlled trials; Searching; Database systems; Manufacture; Sampling; Health care; clinical trial; Cochrane Library; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; data base; EMBASE; human; medical literature; medical research; MEDLINE; quality control; randomized controlled trial; review; Bibliometrics; Databases, Bibliographic; Information Storage and Retrieval; Meta-Analysis; Randomized Controlled Trials; Review Literature; Technology Assessment, Biomedical","Adams, C.E., Power, A., Frederick, K., Lefebvre, C., An investigation of the adequacy of MEDLINE searches for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the effects of mental health care (1994) Psychol Med, 24, pp. 741-748; Brazier, H., Begley, C.M., Selecting a database for literature searches in nursing: MEDLINE or CINAHL?

Nalimov coined the term 'scientometrics' in the 1960s, this term has grown in popularity and is used to describe the study of science: growth, structure, interrelationships and productivity. Scientometrics is related to and has overlapping interests with bibliometrics and informetrics. The terms bibliometrics, scientometrics, and informetrics refer to component fields related to the study of the dynamics of disciplines as reflected in the production of their literature. Areas of study range from charting changes in the output of a scholarly field through time and across countries, to the library collection problem of maintaining control of the output, and to the low publication productivity of most researchers. These terms are used to describe similar and overlapping methodologies. The origins and historical survey of the development of each of these terms are presented. Profiles of the usage of each of these terms over time are presented, using an appropriate subject category of databases on the DIALOG information service. Various definitions of each of the terms are provided from an examination of the literature. The size of the overall literature of these fields is determined and the growth and stabilisation of both the dissertation and non-dissertation literature are shown. A listing of the top journals in the three fields are given, as well as a list of the major reviews and bibliographies that have been published over the years.",,,"Almind, T.C., Ingwersen, P., Informetric analyses on the World Wide Web: Methodological approaches to 'webometrics' (1997) Journal of Documentation, 53, pp. 404-426; Blackert, L., Segel, K., Ist in der wissenschaftlich-technischen information platz für die INFORMETRIE?

After almost a decade of use in Spain, the present article critically reviews the content and metric properties of the Spanish version, as well as its new developments. METHODS: A review of indexed articles that used the Spanish version of the SF-36 was performed in Medline (PubMed), the Spanish bibliographic databases IBECS and IME. Articles that provided information on the measurement model, reliability, validity, and responsiveness to change of the instrument were selected. RESULTS: Seventy-nine articles were found, of which 17 evaluated the metric characteristics of the questionnaire. The reliability of the SF-36 scales was higher than the suggested standard (Cronbach's alpha) of 0.7 in 96% of the evaluations. Grouped evaluations obtained by meta-analysis were higher than 0.7 in all cases. The SF-36 showed good discrimination among severity groups, moderate correlations with clinical indicators, and high correlations with other HRQL instruments. Moreover, questionnaire scores predicted mortality and were able to detect improvement due to therapeutic interventions such as coronary angioplasty, benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery, and non-invasive positive pressure home ventilation. The new developments (norm-based scoring, version 2, the SF-12 and SF-8) improved both the metric properties and interpretation of the questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: The Spanish version of the SF-36 and its recently developed versions is a suitable instrument for use in medical research, as well as in clinical practice.",,"attitude to health; bibliographic database; bibliometrics; clinical trial; health survey; human; language; MEDLINE; meta analysis; prognosis; quality of life; questionnaire; reproducibility; review; Spain; standard; utilization review; Attitude to Health; Bibliometrics; Databases, Bibliographic; Health Surveys; Humans; Language; MEDLINE; Prognosis; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results; Spain",,"Vilagut, G.",,,,,,,,02139111,,,15860162.0,Spanish,Gac Sanit,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-27144503718

This paper provides an in-depth review of the literature on citation impact indicators. First, an overview is given of the literature on bibliographic databases that can be used to calculate citation impact indicators (Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar). Next, selected topics in the literature on citation impact indicators are reviewed in detail. The first topic is the selection of publications and citations to be included in the calculation of citation impact indicators. The second topic is the normalization of citation impact indicators, in particular normalization for field differences. Counting methods for dealing with co-authored publications are the third topic, and citation impact indicators for journals are the last topic. The paper concludes by offering some recommendations for future research. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Bibliographic database; Citation analysis; Citation impact indicator; Counting method; Normalization,Bibliographies; Information services; Vocabulary control; Bibliographic database; Citation analysis; Citation impact; Counting method; Normalization; Information analysis,"Abbas, A.M., Weighted indices for evaluating the quality of research with multiple authorship (2011) Scientometrics, 88 (1), pp. 107-131; Abramo, G., Cicero, T., D'Angelo, C.A., Assessing the varying level of impact measurement accuracy as a function of the citation window length (2011) Journal of Informetrics, 5 (4), pp. 659-667; Abramo, G., Cicero, T., D'Angelo, C.A., A sensitivity analysis of researchers' productivity rankings to the time of citation observation (2012) Journal of Informetrics, 6 (2), pp. 192-201; Abramo, G., Cicero, T., D'Angelo, C.A., A sensitivity analysis of research institutions' productivity rankings to the time of citation observation (2012) Journal of Informetrics, 6 (2), pp. 298-306; Abramo, G., Cicero, T., D'Angelo, C.A., How important is choice of the scaling factor in standardizing citations?

Co-word analysis was employed to reveal patterns and trends in the IR field by measuring the association strengths of terms representative of relevant publications or other texts produced in IR field. Data were collected from Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) for the period of 1987-1997. In addition to the keywords added by the SCI and SSCI databases, other important keywords were extracted from titles and abstracts manually. These keywords were further standardized using vocabulary control tools. In order to trace the dynamic changes of the IR field, the whole 11-year period was further separated into two consecutive periods: 1987-1991 and 1992-1997. The results show that the IR field has some established research themes and it also changes rapidly to embrace new themes. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.",Co-word analysis; Information retrieval research; Research trends; Science citation index; Social science citation index,Data structures; Database systems; Natural language processing systems; Co-word analysis; Information retrieval,"Arabie, P., Carroll, J.D., DeSarbo, W.S., (1987) Three-way scaling and clustering, , Newbury Park: Sage Publications; Bhattacharya, S., Basu, R.K., Mapping a research area at the micro level using co-word analysis (1998) Scientometrics, 43 (3), pp. 359-372; Callon, M., Courtial, J.P., Laville, F., Co-word analysis as a tool for describing the network of interactions between basic and technological research: The case of polymer chemistry (1991) Scientometrics, 22 (1), pp. 153-205; Cambrosio, A., Limoges, C., Courtial, J.P., Laville, F., Historical scientometrics?

Yet no consensus about progress has been achieved in the corporate social responsibility/corporate social performance literature. In this article, we seek to analyze three views on this literature. One view is that development occurred from conceptual vagueness, through clarification of central constructs and their relationships, to the testing of theory - a process supported by increased sophistication in research methods. In contrast, other authors claim that hardly any progress is to be expected because of the inherently normative character of the literature. A final view is that progress in the literature on the social responsibilities of business is obscured or even hampered by the continuing introduction of new constructs. This article explores which of these three views better describes the evolution of the literature during a period of 30 years and suggests implications for further research. © 2005 Sage Publications.",Bibliometry; Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; Theory development,,"Abbott, W.F., Monsen, R.J., On the measurement of corporate social responsibility: Self-reported disclosures as a method of measuring corporate social involvement (1979) Academy of Management Journal, 22 (3), pp. 501-515; Alexander, G.J., Buchholz, R.A., Corporate social responsibility and stock-market performance (1978) Academy of Management Journal, 21 (3), pp. 479-486; Arlow, P., Personal characteristics in college-students evaluations of business ethics and corporate social-responsibility (1991) Journal of Business Ethics, 10 (1), pp. 63-69; Aupperle, K.E., Carroll, A.B., Hatfield, J.D., An empirical-examination of the relationship between corporate social-responsibility and profitability (1985) Academy of Management Journal, 28 (2), pp. 446-463; Barley, S.R., Meyer, G.W., Gash, D.C., Cultures of culture.

Reflecting these developments, many new categories of 'cities' have entered the policy discourse: 'sustainable cities'; 'green cities'; 'digital cities'; 'smart cities'; intelligent cities'; 'information cities'; 'knowledge cities'; 'resilient cities'; 'eco cities'; 'low carbon cities'; 'liveable cities'; and even combinations, such as 'low carbon eco cities' and 'ubiquitous eco cities'. In practice, these terms often appear to be used interchangeably by policy makers, planners and developers. However, the question arises whether these categories nevertheless each embody distinct conceptual perspectives, which would have implications for how they are understood theoretically and applied in policy. In response, this article investigates, through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis, how the twelve most frequent city categories are conceptualised individually and in relation to one another in the academic literature. We hypothesize that, notwithstanding some degree of overlap and cross-fertilization, in their essence the observed categories each harbor particular conceptual perspectives that render them distinctive. This is borne out by the findings, which demonstrate robustly for the first time the conceptual differences and interrelationships among twelve dominant city categories. The 'sustainable city' is the most frequently occurring category and, in a map of keyword co-occurrences, by far the largest and most interconnected node, linked closely to the 'eco city' and 'green city' concepts. Recently, the more narrow concepts of 'low carbon city' and 'smart city' have been on the rise, judging by their frequency of occurrence in academic journals; the latter in particular appears to have become an increasingly dominant category of urban modernization policy. On their part, 'resilient city' and 'knowledge city' represent distinct concepts, albeit with comparatively low frequency. Overall, the findings point to the need for rigor and nuance in the use of these terms, not least if one wishes to comprehend their implications for urban development and regeneration policy and practice. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, IT outsourcing has recently emerged as a significant administrative innovation in an organization's IT strategy. This paper seeks to explore the sources of influence in the adoption of this innovation. For this purpose, we generated a comprehensive sample of outsourcing contracts in the US using an electronic bibliometric search process. Using diffusion modeling, our empirical analysis shows that the adoption of IT outsourcing is motivated more by internal influence (or imitative behavior) than by external influence amongst the user organizations. Subsequently, we considered the widely publicized Eastman Kodak's outsourcing decision as a critical event to assess whether this internal influence is more pronounced in the post-Kodak regime than in the pre- Kodak regime. Our results show that internal influence is dominant in the post-Kodak regime but not in the pre-Kodak regime. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

We use the results of a large evaluation study of 147 university chemistry research groups in the Netherlands covering the work of about 700 senior researchers during the period 1991-2000. Thus, we deal with research groups rather than individual scientists, as we consider the research group as the most important work floor unit in research, particularly in the natural sciences. Furthermore, we restrict the citation period to a three-year window instead of 'life time counts' in order to focus on the impact of recent work and thus on current research performance. Results show that the h-index and our bibliometric 'crown indicator' both relate in a quite comparable way with peer judgments. But for smaller groups in fields with 'less heavy citation traffic' the crown indicator appears to be a more appropriate measure of research performance.

Other databases are now available, but their relative performance has not been established. Objective: To compare the citation count profiles of articles published in general medical journals among the citation databases of Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Design: Cohort study of 328 articles published in JAMA, Lancet, or the New England Journal of Medicine between October 1, 1999, and March 31, 2000. Total citation counts for each article up to June 2008 were retrieved from Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Article characteristics were analyzed in linear regression models to determine interaction with the databases. Main Outcome Measures: Number of citations received by an article since publication and article characteristics associated with citation in databases. Results: Google Scholar and Scopus retrieved more citations per article with a median of 160 (interquartile range [IQR], 83 to 324) and 149 (IQR, 78 to 289), respectively, than Web of Science (median, 122; IQR, 66 to 241) (P<.001 for both comparisons). Compared with Web of Science, Scopus retrieved more citations from non-English-language sources (median, 10.2% vs 4.1%) and reviews (30.8% vs 18.2%), and fewer citations from articles (57.2% vs 70.5%), editorials (2.1% vs 5.9%), and letters (0.8% vs 2.6%) (all P<.001). On a log10-transformed scale, fewer citations were found in Google Scholar to articles with declared industry funding (nonstandardized regression coefficient, -0.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.15 to -0.03), reporting a study of a drug or medical device (-0.05; 95% CI, -0.11 to 0.01), or with group authorship (-0.29; 95% CI, -0.35 to -0.23). In multivariable analysis, group authorship was the only characteristic that differed among the databases; Google Scholar had significantly fewer citations to group-authored articles (-0.30; 95% CI, -0.36 to -0.23) compared with Web of Science. Conclusion: Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar produced quantitatively and qualitatively different citation counts for articles published in 3 general medical journals. ©2009 American Medical Association.

In general, these analyses proceed by considering the similarity of articles or journals and submitting the set of similarity measures to some clustering or scaling procedure. Two common methods are found in bibliometric coupling, where two citing articles are similar to the extent they cite the same literature, and co-citation analysis where cited articles are similar to the extent they are cited by the same citing articles. Methods based on structural and regular equivalence also seek to partition the article based on their positional location. Such methods have in common focus on the articles and partitions of them. We propose a quite different approach where the connective threads through a network are preserved and the focus is on the links in the network rather than on the nodes. Variants of the depth first search algorithm are used to detect and represent the mainstream of the literature of a clearly delineated area of scientific research. The specific citation network is one that consists of ties among the key events and papers that lead to the discovery and modeling of DNA together with the final experimental confirmation of its representation. © 1989.",,,"Asimov, (1963) The Genetic Code, , New American Library, New York; Atkin, (1977) Combinatorial Connectivities in Social Systems, , Birkhauser, Basel; Breiger, Career attributes and network structure: A block model study of a biomedical research specialty (1976) American Sociological Review, 41, pp. 118-135; Breiger, Boorman, Arabie, An algorithm for clustering relational data with applications to social network analysis and comparison with multidimensional scaling (1975) Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 12, pp. 328-383; Burt, Position in networks (1976) Social Forces, 55, pp. 93-122; Burt, Structure: Sociometric indices, cliques, structural equivalence, density tables, contagion, structural autonomy and equilibrium in multiple network systems (1987) Technical Report 3.2, , Research Program in Structural Analysis, Columbia University; Callon, Courtial, Turner, Bauin, From translations to problematic networks An introduction in co-word analysis (1983) Social Science Information, 22, pp. 191-235; Carpenter, Narin, Clustering of scientific journals (1973) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 24, pp. 425-436; Doreian, Structural equivalence in a psychology journal network (1985) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 36, pp. 411-417; Doreian, A revised measure of standing for journals in journal networks (1987) Scientometrics, 11, pp. 71-80; Doreian, Fararo, Structural equivalence in a journal network (1985) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 36, pp. 28-37; Freeman, Centrality in social networks: I Conceptual clarification (1978) Social Networks, 1, pp. 215-239; Garfield, Citation indexes for sciences (1955) Science, 122 (3159), pp. 108-111; Garfield, (1979) Citation Indexing — Its Theory and Application in Science, Technology, and Humanities, , Institute for Scientific Information Press, Philadelphia; Garfield, Sher, Torpie, (1964) The Use of Citation Data in Writing the History of Science, , Institute for Scientific Information, Philadelphia; Griffith, Small, Stonehill, Dey, The structure of scientific literature II Toward a macro- and micro-structure for science (1974) Social Studies of Science, 4, pp. 339-365; Kessler, Bibliographic coupling between scientific papers (1963) American Documentation, 14, pp. 10-25; Lenoir, Quantitative foundations for the sociology of science On linking block modeling with co-citation analysis (1979) Social Studies of Science, 9, pp. 455-480; Lorrain, White, Structural equivalence of individuals in social networks (1971) The Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 1, pp. 49-80; Narin, Carpenter, Berlt, Interrelationships of scientific Journals (1972) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 23, pp. 323-331; Noma, (1987) Using influence weights to evaluate the scientific importance of journals, , Booz Allen and Hamilton, Philadelphia, (preprint); Pinski, Narin, Citation influence for journal aggregates of scientific publications: Theory with application to literature of physics (1979) Information Processing and Management, 12, pp. 297-312; Price, Networks of scientific papers (1965) Science, 149, pp. 510-515; Small, Co-citation in the scientific literature: A new measure of the relationship between two documents (1973) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 24, pp. 265-269; Small, A Co-citation model of a scientific specialty A longitudinal study of collagen research (1977) Social Studies of Science, 7, pp. 139-166; Small, Griffith, The structure of scientific literature I Identifying and graphing specialties (1974) Social Studies of Science, 4, pp. 17-40; White, Reitz, Grasp and semi-group homomorphisms on networks of relations (1983) Social Networks, 5, pp. 193-234","Hummon, N.P.; Department of Sociology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburg, PA 15260, United States",,,,,,,,03788733,,,,English,Soc.

In response, this paper investigates 2,448,055 citations to 2299 English-language highly-cited documents from 252 GS subject categories published in 2006, comparing GS, the WoS Core Collection, and Scopus. GS consistently found the largest percentage of citations across all areas (93%-96%), far ahead of Scopus (35%-77%) and WoS (27%-73%). GS found nearly all the WoS (95%) and Scopus (92%) citations. Most citations found only by GS were from non-journal sources (48%-65%), including theses, books, conference papers, and unpublished materials. Many were non-English (19%-38%), and they tended to be much less cited than citing sources that were also in Scopus or WoS. Despite the many unique GS citing sources, Spearman correlations between citation counts in GS and WoS or Scopus are high (0.78-0.99). They are lower in the Humanities, and lower between GS and WoS than between GS and Scopus. The results suggest that in all areas GS citation data is essentially a superset of WoS and Scopus, with substantial extra coverage. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the evidence has been anecdotal or partial. Here we investigate how the degree of interdisciplinarity has changed between 1975 and 2005 over six research domains. To do so, we compute well-established bibliometric indicators alongside a new index of interdisciplinarity (Integration score, aka Rao-Stirling diversity) and a science mapping visualization method. The results attest to notable changes in research practices over this 30 year period, namely major increases in number of cited disciplines and references per article (both show about 50% growth), and co-authors per article (about 75% growth). However, the new index of interdisciplinarity only shows a modest increase (mostly around 5% growth). Science maps hint that this is because the distribution of citations of an article remains mainly within neighboring disciplinary areas. These findings suggest that science is indeed becoming more interdisciplinary, but in small steps - drawing mainly from neighboring fields and only modestly increasing the connections to distant cognitive areas. The combination of metrics and overlay science maps provides general benchmarks for future studies of interdisciplinary research characteristics. © 2009 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.",,,"Abt, H.A., The frequencies of multinational papers in various sciences (2007) Scientometrics, 71 (1), pp. 105-115; Abt, H.A., The future of single-authored papers (2007) Scientometrics, 73 (3), pp. 353-358; Adams, J., Jackson, L., Marshall, S., (2007) Bibliometric Analysis of Interdisciplinary Research, , Report for HEFCE.

This paper presents an alternative source of data (Googl Scholar, GS) as well as 3 alternatives to the JIF to assess journal impact (h-index, g-index and the number of citations per paper), Becatise of its broader range of data sources, the use of GS generally results in more comprehensive citation coverage in the area of management and international business. The use of GS particularly benefits academics publishing in sources that are not (well) covered in ISI. Among these are books, conference papers, non-US journals, and in general journals in the field of strategy and international business. The 3 alternative GS-based metrics showed strong correlations with the traditional JIR. As such, they provide academics and universities committed to JIFs with a good alternative for journals that are not ISI-indexed. However, we argue that these metrics provide additional advantages over the JIF and that the free availability of GS allows for a democratization of citation analysis as it provides every academic access to citation data regardless of their institution's financial means. © Inter-Research 2008.",Citation analysis; g-index; Google Scholar; h-index; Journal impact factor; Publish or perish,publishing; textbook; World Wide Web,"Archambault, E., Gagné, E.V., (2004) The use of bibliometrics in social sciences and humanities, , Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, Montreal; Belew RK (2005) Scientific impact quantity and quality; analysis of two sources of bibliographic data. arXiv:cs.IR/0504036 v1, 11 April 2005.

We found 53 research papers on this topic, published from 01.01.2008 to 31.12.2017. Methods: An initial bibliometric analysis shows that the reviewed papers focused on Electromyogram(EMG), Electroencephalogram(EEG), Electrocardiogram(ECG), and Electrooculogram(EOG). These four categories were used to structure the subsequent content review. Results: During the content review, we understood that deep learning performs better for big and varied datasets than classic analysis and machine classification methods. Deep learning algorithms try to develop the model by using all the available input. Conclusions: This review paper depicts the application of various deep learning algorithms used till recently, but in future it will be used for more healthcare areas to improve the quality of diagnosis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Deep learning; Electrocardiogram; Electroencephalogram; Electromyogram; Electrooculogram; Physiological signals,"Classification (of information); Electrocardiography; Electroencephalography; Health care; Learning algorithms; Physiology; Bibliometric analysis; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Electro-oculogram; Electromyo grams; Health care application; Machine classifications; Physiological signals; Scientific researches; Deep learning; classification; diagnosis; electrocardiogram; electromyogram; electrooculogram; human; learning algorithm; machine; review; algorithm; computer assisted diagnosis; electrocardiography; electroencephalography; electromyography; electrooculography; health care quality; machine learning; medical informatics; nerve cell; procedures; signal processing; statistical model; Algorithms; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Electrocardiography; Electroencephalography; Electromyography; Electrooculography; Humans; Linear Models; Machine Learning; Medical Informatics; Neurons; Quality of Health Care; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Faust, O., Bairy, M.G., Nonlinear analysis of physiological signals: a review (2012) J.

However, empiric studies on impact factor's validity as an indicator of quality are lacking. The authors assessed the validity of impact factor as a measure of quality for general medical journals by testing its association with journal quality as rated by clinical practitioners and researchers. Methods: We surveyed physicians specializing in internal medicine in the United States, randomly sampled from the American Medical Association's Physician Masterfile (practitioner group, n = 113) and from a list of graduates from a national postdoctoral training program in clinical and health services research (research group, n = 151). Respondents rated the quality of nine general medical journals, and we assessed the correlation between these ratings and the journals' impact factors. Results: The correlation between impact factor and physicians' ratings of journal quality was strong (r2 = 0.82, P = 0.001). The correlation was higher for the research group (r2 = 0.83, P = 0.001) than for the practitioner group (r2 = 0.62, P = 0.01). Conclusions: Impact factor may be a reasonable indicator of quality for general medical journals.",,article; clinical research; correlation analysis; evaluation; health practitioner; health services research; medical literature; publication; quality control; Adult; Bibliometrics; Female; Humans; Internal Medicine; Library Collection Development; Male; Middle Aged; Periodicals; Physicians; Questionnaires; Random Allocation; Reproducibility of Results; Research Personnel; Sex Factors; Social Change; United States,"Garfield, E., Journal impact factor: A brief review (1999) Can Med Assoc J, 161 (8), pp. 979-980. , Oct 19; Garfield, E., The impact factor (1994) Curr Contents, 25, pp. 3-7. , http://sunweb.isinet.com/isi/hot/essays/journalcitationreports/7.html, [Internet] Jun 20; Seglen, P.O., Why the impact factor of journals should not be used for evaluating research (1997) BMJ, 314 (7079), pp. 498-502. , Feb 15; Lowy, C., Impact factor limits funding (1997) Lancet, 350 (9083), p. 1035. , Oct 4; SEGLEN, op. cit; Hansson, S., Impact factor as a misleading tool in evaluation of medical journals (1995) Lancet, 346 (8979), p. 906. , Sep 30; Foster, W.R., Impact factor as the best operational measure of medical journals (1995) Lancet, 346 (8985), p. 1301. , Nov 11; Christakis, D.A., Saint, S., Saha, S., Elmore, J.G., Welsh, D.E., Baker, P., Koepsell, T.D., Do physicians judge a study by its cover? an investigation of journal attribution bias (2000) J Clin Epidemiol, 53 (8), pp. 773-778. , Aug; (1998) 1997 SCI Journal Citation Reports, , Philadelphia, PA: Institute for Scientific Information; Kleinbaum, D.G., Kupper, L.L., Muller, K.E., (1988) Applied Regression and Other Multivariable Methods, , Belmont, CA: Duxbury Press; Foster, op. cit; Tsay, M.Y., The relationship between journal use in a medical library and citation use (1998) Bull Med Libr Assoc, 86 (1), pp. 31-39. , Jan; Tsay, M.Y., The relationship between journal use in a medical library and citation use (1998) Bull Med Libr Assoc, 86 (1), p. 39. , Jan; Tsay, M.Y., The relationship between journal use in a medical library and citation use (1998) Bull Med Libr Assoc, 86 (1), pp. 33-35. , Jan; (1998) Physician Characteristics and Distribution in the U.S., , Chicago, IL: The Association","Saha, S.; Div. of General Internal Medicine, 3710 SW.

Bellg, B. Borrelli, et al. (2004) previously developed a framework that consisted of strategies to enhance treatment fidelity of health behavior interventions. The present study used this framework to (a) develop a measure of treatment fidelity and (b) use the measure to evaluate treatment fidelity in articles published in 5 journals over 10 years. Three hundred forty-two articles met inclusion criteria; 22% reported strategies to maintain provider skills, 27% reported checking adherence to protocol, 35% reported using a treatment manual, 54% reported using none of these strategies, and 12% reported using all 3 strategies. The mean proportion adherence to treatment fidelity strategies was .55; 15.5% of articles achieved greater than or equal to .80. This tool may be useful for researchers, grant reviewers, and editors planning and evaluating trials.

The tremendous growth of collaboration among nations and research institutions witnessed during the last twenty years is a function of the internal dynamics of science as well as science policy initiatives. The need to survey and follow up the collaboration issue calls for statistical indicators sensitive enough to reveal the structure and change of collaborative networks. In this context, bibliometric analysis of co-authored scientific articles is one promising approach.

This literature review began with a narrow search for quantitative measures of the output of IDR that could contribute to indicators, but the authors expanded the scope of the review as it became clear that differing definitions, assessment tools, evaluation processes, and measures all shed light on different aspects of IDR. Key among these broader aspects is (a) the importance of incorporating the concept of knowledge integration, and (b) recognizing that integration can occur within a single mind as well as among a team. Existing output measures alone cannot adequately capture this process. Among the quantitative measures considered, bibliometrics (co-authorships, co-inventors, collaborations, references, citations and co-citations) are the most developed, but leave considerable gaps in understanding of the social dynamics that lead to knowledge integration. Emerging measures in network dynamics (particularly betweenness centrality and diversity), and entropy are promising as indicators, but their use requires sophisticated interpretations. Combinations of quantitative measures and qualitative assessments being applied within evaluation studies appear to reveal IDR processes but carry burdens of expense, intrusion, and lack of reproducibility year-upon-year. This review is a first step toward providing a more holistic view of measuring IDR, although research and development is needed before metrics can adequately reflect the actual phenomenon of IDR. © 2010.",Bibliometrics; Evaluation; Indicators; Interdisciplinary; Research; Science,,"Adams, J., Jackson, L., Marshall, S., (2007) Report to the Higher Education Funding Council for England: Bibliometric analysis of interdisciplinary research, , Evidence, Ltd, Leeds, UK; Bar-Ilan, J., Levene, M., Lin, A., Some measures for comparing citation databases (2007) Journal of Informetrics, 1, pp. 26-34; Boulding, K.E., General systems theory: The skeleton of science (1956) Management Science, 2, pp. 197-208; Boyack, K.W., Mapping knowledge domains: Characterizing PNAS (2004) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 101, pp. 5192-5199; Callon, M., Law, J., From translations to problematic networks: An introduction to co-word analysis (1983) Social Science Information, 22, pp. 191-235; Chen, C., Searching for intellectual turning points: Progressive knowledge domain visualization (2004) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 101, pp. 5303-5310; Chen, C., Chen, Y., Horowitz, M., Hou, H., Liu, Z., Pellegrino, D., Towards an explanatory and computational theory of scientific discovery (2009) Journal of Informetrics, 3 (3), pp. 191-209; Croyle, R.T., The National Cancer Institute's transdisciplinary centers initiatives and the need for building a science of team science (2008) American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 35, pp. S90-S93; Darden, L., Maull, N., Interfield Theories (1977) Philosophy of Science, 44 (1), pp. 43-64. , March; (1978) Toward a metric of science: The advent of science indicators, , John Wiley, New York, Y.

In this article, the authors critically examine the scientific literature from 1982 to 2006 on the concept of health information-seeking behavior (HISB) to determine its level of maturity and clarify the concept's essential characteristics. A principle-based method of concept analysis provides the framework for exploring the nature of HISB. The authors reviewed approximately 100 published articles and five books reporting on HISB. Although HISB is a popular concept used in various contexts, most HISB definitions provide little insight into the concept's specific meanings. The authors describe the concept's characteristics, contributing to a clearer understanding of HISB, and discuss operationalizations, antecedents, and outcomes of HISB. Such an analysis of HISB might guide further theorizing on this highly relevant concept and assist health care providers in designing optimal informational interventions. © 2007 Sage Publications.",Concept analysis; Health information; Information seeking,concept analysis; coping behavior; data analysis; health behavior; health promotion; health status; human; medical information; priority journal; psychological aspect; review; scientific literature; social adaptation; Bibliometrics; Books; Consumer Health Information; Humans; Information Services; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Periodicals as Topic; United States,"Allen, B., Information needs: A person-in-situation approach (1996) Information Seeking in Context, pp. 111-122. , In P.

A case study presents a workable method for general informetric analyses of the www. In detail, the paper describes a number of specific informetric analysis parameters. As a case study the Danish proportion of the WWW is compared to those of other Nordic countries. The methodological approach is comparable with common bibliometric analyses of the ISI citation databases. Among other results the analyses demonstrate that Denmark would seem to fall seriously behind the other Nordic countries with respect to visibility on the Net and compared to its position in scientific databases.",,,"Camron, R.D., (1995) A Universal Citation Database As a Catalyst for Reform in Scholarly Communication, , http://elib.cs.sfu.ca/projects/ElectronicLibrary/project/papers/citebase/ citebase.html; Larson, R.R., Bibliornetrics of the world wide web: An exploratory analysis of the intellectual structure of cyberspace (1996) Proceedings of the 59th ASIS Annual Meeting, , http://Sherlock.berkeley.edu/asis96/asis96.html, Baltimore, Maryland; Paisley, W., The future of bibliometrics (1990) Scholarly Communication and Bibliometrics, pp. 281-299. , Borgman, C.L., ed.

The methods are used increasingly when studying various aspects of science and also in the way institutions and universities are ranked worldwide. A sufficient number of studies have been completed, and with the resulting literature, it is now possible to analyse the bibliometric method by using its own methodology. The bibliometric literature in this study, which was extracted from Web of Science, is divided into two parts using a method comparable to the method of Jonkers et al. (Characteristics of bibliometrics articles in library and information sciences (LIS) and other journals, pp. 449–551, 2012: The publications either lie within the Information and Library Science (ILS) category or within the non-ILS category which includes more applied, “subject” based studies. The impact in the different groupings is judged by means of citation analysis using normalized data and an almost linear increase can be observed from 1994 onwards in the non-ILS category. The implication for the dissemination and use of the bibliometric methods in the different contexts is discussed. A keyword analysis identifies the most popular subjects covered by bibliometric analysis, and multidisciplinary articles are shown to have the highest impact. A noticeable shift is observed in those countries which contribute to the pool of bibliometric analysis, as well as a self-perpetuating effect in giving and taking references. © 2015, The Author(s).",Bibliometric analysis; Citation analysis; Impact of publications; Publication analysis,,"Ardanuy, J., Sixty years of citation analysis studies in the humanities (1951–2010) (2013) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 64 (8), pp. 1751-1755; Bar-Ilan, J., Informetrics at the beginning of the 21st century-A review (2008) Journal of Informetrics, 2 (1), pp. 1-52; Bar-Ilan, J., Citations to the “Introduction to informetrics” indexed by WOS, Scopus and Google Scholar (2010) Scientometrics, 82 (3), pp. 495-506; Barth, M., Haustein, S., Scheidt, B., The life sciences in German–Chinese cooperation: an institutional-level co-publication analysis (2014) Scientometrics, 98 (1), pp. 99-117; Bastian, M., Heymann, S., Jacomy, M., Gephi: an open source software for exploring and manipulating networks (2009) ICWSM, 8, pp. 361-362; Dalpe, R., Bibliometric analysis of biotechnology (2002) Scientometrics, 55 (2), pp. 189-213; DeLooze, M.A., Lemarie, J., Corpus relevance through co-word analysis: an application to plant proteins (1997) Scientometrics, 39 (3), pp. 267-280; Derrick, G., Jonkers, K., Lewison, G., Characteristics of bibliometrics articles in library and information sciences (LIS) and other journals.

How can we achieve a good decomposition? The ISI subject categories classify journals included in the Science Citation Index (SCI). The aggregated journal-journal citation matrix contained in the Journal Citation Reports can be aggregated on the basis of these categories. This leads to an asymmetrical matrix (citing versus cited) that is much more densely populated than the underlying matrix at the journal level. Exploratory factor analysis of the matrix of subject categories suggests a 14-factor solution. This solution could be interpreted as the disciplinary structure of science. The nested maps of science (corresponding to 14 factors, 172 categories, and 6,164 journals) are online at http://www.leydesdorff.net/map06. Presumably, inaccuracies in the attribution of journals to the ISI subject categories average out so that the factor analysis reveals the main structures.The mapping of science could, therefore, be comprehensive and reliable on a large scale albeit imprecise in terms of the attribution of journals to the ISI subject categories.",,Exploratory factor analysis; Factor analysis; Global maps; Journal citation reports; Mapping of science; matrixes; Science citation indices; Scientific literatures; Scientometrics; Intersymbol interference,"Adler, R., Ewing, J., Taylor, P., (2008) Citation statistics: A report from the International Mathematical Union (IMU) in cooperation with the International Council of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM) and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, , http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/IMU/Repo.rt/CitationStatistics.pdf, IMS, Retrieved from; Ahlgren, P., Jarneving, B., Rousseau, R., Requirement for a Cocitation Similarity Measure, with Special Reference to Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (2003) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 54, pp. 550-560; Ando, A., Fisher, F.M., Near-decomposability, partition and aggregation, and the relevance of stability discussions (1963) International Economic Review, 4 (1), pp. 53-67; Batagelj, V., Mrvar, A., (2007) Pajek, , http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek, Program for large network analysis.

They show achievement of promise in analysing (1) international patterns of innovative activities and their effects on trade and production; (2) patterns of innovative activities amongst firms, and their effects on firm performance and industrial structure; (3) rates and directions of innovative activities in different technical fields and industrial sectors; (4) links between science and technology. However, systematic biases remain in patent statistics, the full assessment of which require further econometric, classificatory and survey research. © 1985 Akadémiai Kiadó.",,,"J.

These so-called predatory publishers are causing unfounded negative publicity for open access publishing in general. Reports about this branch of e-business have so far mainly concentrated on exposing lacking peer review and scandals involving publishers and journals. There is a lack of comprehensive studies about several aspects of this phenomenon, including extent and regional distribution. Methods: After an initial scan of all predatory publishers and journals included in the so-called Beall's list, a sample of 613 journals was constructed using a stratified sampling method from the total of over 11,000 journals identified. Information about the subject field, country of publisher, article processing charge and article volumes published between 2010 and 2014 were manually collected from the journal websites. For a subset of journals, individual articles were sampled in order to study the country affiliation of authors and the publication delays. Results: Over the studied period, predatory journals have rapidly increased their publication volumes from 53,000 in 2010 to an estimated 420,000 articles in 2014, published by around 8,000 active journals. Early on, publishers with more than 100 journals dominated the market, but since 2012 publishers in the 10-99 journal size category have captured the largest market share. The regional distribution of both the publisher's country and authorship is highly skewed, in particular Asia and Africa contributed three quarters of authors. Authors paid an average article processing charge of 178 USD per article for articles typically published within 2 to 3 months of submission. Conclusions: Despite a total number of journals and publishing volumes comparable to respectable (indexed by the Directory of Open Access Journals) open access journals, the problem of predatory open access seems highly contained to just a few countries, where the academic evaluation practices strongly favor international publication, but without further quality checks. © 2015 Shen and Björk.",Open access; Scientific publishing,Africa; Article; Asia; controlled study; longitudinal study; marketing; peer review; publication; scientific literature; access to information; bibliometrics; human; publishing; standards; writing; Access to Information; Authorship; Bibliometrics; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Peer Review; Periodicals as Topic; Publishing,"Tenopir, C., King, D., Towards electronic journals: realities for scientists, librarians and publishers (2000), Washington, DC: SLA Publishing; Suber, P., Open access (2012), Boston, MA: MIT Press; Björk, B.-C., The hybrid model for open access publication of scholarly articles - a failed experiment?

As research in these areas advances rapidly, it is critical to keep abreast of emerging trends and critical turns of the development of the collective knowledge. Areas covered: A progressively synthesized network is derived from 35,963 original research and review articles that cite 3875 articles obtained from an initial topic search on regenerative medicine between 2000 and 2011. CiteSpace is used to facilitate the analysis of the intellectual structure and emerging trends. Expert opinion: A major ongoing research trend is concerned with finding alternative reprogramming techniques as well as refining existing ones for induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). A more recent emerging trend focuses on the structural and functional equivalence between iPSCs and human embryonic stem cells and potential clinical and therapeutic implications on regenerative medicine in a long run. The two trends overlap in terms of what they cite, but they are distinct and have different implications on future research. Visual analytics of the literature provides a valuable, timely, repeatable and flexible approach in addition to traditional systematic reviews so as to track the development of new emerging trends and identify critical evidence. © Informa UK, Ltd.",CiteSpace; co-citation analysis; induced pluripotent stem cells; regenerative medicine; scientometrics,bevacizumab; cancer prevention; cancer stem cell; cell strain; Drosophila; embryonic stem cell; human; melanoma cell; mesenchymal stem cell; neoplasm; nonhuman; pluripotent stem cell; regenerative medicine; review; spermatogenesis; stomach cancer; Embryonic Stem Cells; Humans; Regenerative Medicine,"Polykandriotis, E., Popescu, L.M., Horch, R.E., Regenerative medicine: Then and now - An update of recent history into future possibilities (2010) J Cell Mol Med, 14 (10), pp. 2350-2358; Glotzbach, J.P., Wong, V.W., Gurtner, G.C., Longaker, M.T., Regenerative medicine (2011) Curr Probl Surg, 48 (3), pp. 148-212; Polak, D.J., Regenerative medicine.

Community detection constitutes a significant tool for the analysis of complex networks by enabling the study of mesoscopic structures that are often associated with organizational and functional characteristics of the underlying networks. Community detection has proven to be valuable in a series of domains, e.g. biology, social sciences, bibliometrics. However, despite the unprecedented scale, complexity and the dynamic nature of the networks derived from Social Media data, there has only been limited discussion of community detection in this context. More specifically, there is hardly any discussion on the performance characteristics of community detection methods as well as the exploitation of their results in the context of real-world web mining and information retrieval scenarios. To this end, this survey first frames the concept of community and the problem of community detection in the context of Social Media, and provides a compact classification of existing algorithms based on their methodological principles. The survey places special emphasis on the performance of existing methods in terms of computational complexity and memory requirements. It presents both a theoretical and an experimental comparative discussion of several popular methods. In addition, it discusses the possibility for incremental application of the methods and proposes five strategies for scaling community detection to real-world networks of huge scales. Finally, the survey deals with the interpretation and exploitation of community detection results in the context of intelligent web applications and services. © The Author(s) 2011.",Community detection; Large-scale networks; Social Media,Complex networks; Data mining; Surveys; Community detection; Functional characteristics; Large-scale network; Memory requirements; Mesoscopic structure; Performance and applications; Performance characteristics; Social media; Population dynamics,"Agichtein, E., Castillo, C., Donato, D., Gionis, A., Mishne, G., Finding high-quality content in social media (2008) Proceedings of WSDM ?08: The International Conference on Web Search and Web Data Mining, pp. 183-194. , Palo Alto, CA, USA, 11-12 Feb 2008 ACM, New York; Andersen, R., Frk, C., Lang, K., Local graph partitioning using PageRank vectors (2006) FOCS?06: Proceedings of the 47th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, pp. 475-486; Arenas, A., Díaz-Guilera, A., Pérez-Vicente, C.J., Synchronization reveals topological scales in complex networks (2006) Phys Rev Lett, 96 (11), p. 114102; Arenas, A., Duch, J., Fernaández, A., Gómez, S., Size reduction of complex networks preserving modularity (2007) New J Phys, 9, p. 176; Asur, S., Parthasarathy, S., Ucar, D., An event-based framework for characterizing the evolutionary behavior of interaction graphs (2007) Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 913-921. , San Jose, CA, USA, 12-15 Aug 2007.

To facilitate instrument selection, our aim was to develop a highly sensitive search filter for finding studies on measurement properties of measurement instruments in PubMed and a more precise search filter that needs less abstracts to be screened, but at a higher risk of missing relevant studies. Methods: A random sample of 10,000 PubMed records (01-01-1990 to 31-12-2006) was used as a gold standard. Studies on measurement properties were identified using an exclusion filter and hand searching. Search terms were selected from the relevant records in the gold standard as well as from 100 systematic reviews of measurement properties and combined based on sensitivity and precision. The performance of the filters was tested in the gold standard as well as in two validation sets, by calculating sensitivity, precision, specificity, and number needed to read. Results: We identified 116 studies on measurement properties in the gold standard. The sensitive search filter was able to retrieve 113 of these 116 studies (sensitivity 97.4%, precision 4.4%). The precise search filter had a sensitivity of 93.1% and a precision of 9.4%. Both filters performed very well in the validation sets.

Poor searches may fail to identify existing evidence because of inadequate recall (sensitivity) or increase the resource requirements of reviews as a result of inadequate precision. Our objective was to create an annotated checklist for electronic search strategy peer review. Study Design: A systematic review of the library and information retrieval literature for important elements in electronic search strategies was conducted, along with a survey of individuals experienced in systematic review searching. Results: Six elements with a strong consensus as to their importance in peer review were accurate translation of the research question into search concepts, correct choice of Boolean operators and of line numbers, adequate translation of the search strategy for each database, inclusion of relevant subject headings, and absence of spelling errors. Seven additional elements had partial support and are included in this guideline. Conclusion: This evidence-based guideline facilitates the improvement of search quality through peer review, and thus the improvement in quality of systematic reviews. It is relevant for librarians/information specialists, journal editors, developers of knowledge translation tools, research organizations, and funding bodies. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

It is perhaps the most popular bibliometric product used in bibliometrics itself, as well as outside the scientific community. First, a concise review of the background and history of the ISI impact factor and the basic ideas underlying it are given. A cross-citation matrix is used to visualise the construction of the Impact Factor and several related journal citation measures. Both strengths and flaws of the impact factor are discussed. Several attempts made by different authors to introduce more sophisticated journal citation measures and the reasons why many indicators aiming at a correction of methodological limitations of the Impact Factor were not successful are described. The next section is devoted to the analysis of basic technical and methodological aspects. In this context, the most important sources of possible biases and distortions for calculation and use of journal citation measures are studied. Thereafter, main characteristics of application contexts are summarised. The last section is concerned with questions of statistical reliability of journal citation measures. It is shown that in contrast to a common misbelief statistical methods can be applied to discrete 'skewed' distributions, and that the statistical reliability of these statistics can be used as a basis for application of journal impact measures in comparative analyses. Finally, the question of sufficiency or insufficiency of a single, howsoever complex measure for characterising the citation impact of scientific journals is discussed.",,,,"Glänzel, W.; Bibliometrics Services, P.

By using authors as the units of analysis and incorporating all the citations that are included in the Science Citation Index and the Social Science Citation Index, we trace the evolution of the intellectual structure of the strategic management field during the period 1980-2000. Using a variety of data analytic techniques such as multidimensional scaling, factor analysis, and Pathfinder analysis, we (1) delineate the subfields that constitute the intellectual structure of strategic management; (2) determine the relationships between the subfields; (3) identify authors who play a pivotal role in bridging two or more conceptual domains of research; and (4) graphically map the intellectual structure in two-dimensional space in order to visualize spatial distances between intellectual themes. The analysis provides insights about the influence of individual authors as well as changes in their influence over time.

Martin Jischke Drive, West Lafayette, IN 47907, United States","Controlled drug delivery technology has progressed over the last six decades. This progression began in 1952 with the introduction of the first sustained release formulation. The 1st generation of drug delivery (1950-1980) focused on developing oral and transdermal sustained release systems and establishing controlled drug release mechanisms. The 2nd generation (1980-2010) was dedicated to the development of zero-order release systems, self-regulated drug delivery systems, long-term depot formulations, and nanotechnology-based delivery systems. The latter part of the 2nd generation was largely focused on studying nanoparticle formulations. The Journal of Controlled Release (JCR) has played a pivotal role in the 2nd generation of drug delivery technologies, and it will continue playing a leading role in the next generation. The best path towards a productive 3rd generation of drug delivery technology requires an honest, open dialog without any preconceived ideas of the past. The drug delivery field needs to take a bold approach to designing future drug delivery formulations primarily based on today's necessities, to produce the necessary innovations. The JCR provides a forum for sharing the new ideas that will shape the 3rd generation of drug delivery technology. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Depot formulations; Evolution of drug delivery; Modulated delivery; Smart polymers; Targeted delivery,"Drug products; Targeted drug delivery; Controlled drug delivery systems; Depot formulations; Drug delivery formulations; Drug delivery technologies; Modulated delivery; Nanoparticle formulation; Smart polymers; Targeted delivery; Controlled drug delivery; chitosan; dendrimer; nanoparticle; polymer; small interfering RNA; acetylsalicylic acid; delayed release formulation; article; controlled drug release; drug delivery system; drug research; human; hydrogel; nanotechnology; nonhuman; priority journal; basic research; controlled drug release; medical research; Review; sustained drug release; bibliometrics; delayed release formulation; drug delivery system; forecasting; history; publication; trends; Bibliometrics; Biomedical Research; Delayed-Action Preparations; Drug Delivery Systems; Forecasting; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Nanoparticles; Periodicals as Topic","Heller, J., Feijen, J., Editorial (1984) J.

Our results confirm that the presence and density of social media altmetric counts are still very low and not very frequent among scientific publications, with 15%-24% of the publications presenting some altmetric activity and concentrated on the most recent publications, although their presence is increasing over time. Publications from the social sciences, humanities, and the medical and life sciences show the highest presence of altmetrics, indicating their potential value and interest for these fields. The analysis of the relationships between altmetrics and citations confirms previous claims of positive correlations but is relatively weak, thus supporting the idea that altmetrics do not reflect the same kind of impact as citations. Also, altmetric counts do not always present a better filtering of highly-cited publications than journal citation scores. Altmetric scores (particularly mentions in blogs) are able to identify highly-cited publications with higher levels of precision than journal citation scores (JCS), but they have a lower level of recall. The value of altmetrics as a complementary tool of citation analysis is highlighted, although more research is suggested to disentangle the potential meaning and value of altmetric indicators for research evaluation. © 2014 ASIS&T.",bibliometrics; databases,Database systems; Social networking (online); Bibliometrics; Citation analysis; Complementary tools; Multidisciplinary perspectives; Positive correlations; Research evaluation; Scientific fields; Scientific publications; Publishing; biomedicine; citation analysis; filtration; human; humanities; publication; recall; social media; sociology,"Adie, E., Roe, W., Altmetric: Enriching scholarly content with article-level discussion and metrics (2013) Learned Publishing, 26 (1), pp. 11-17; Bar-Ilan, J., JASIST@ Mendeley (2012) ACM Web Science Conference Workshop on Altmetrics, , http://altmetrics.org/altmetrics12/bar-ilan/, Presented at, Evanston, IL, 21 June 2012; Bar-Ilan, J., Haustein, S., Peters, I., Priem, J., Shema, H., Terliesner, J., Beyond citations: Scholars' visibility on the social Web (2012) Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Science and Technology Indicators, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5611/, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Costas, R., Van Leeuwen, T.N., Bordons, M., A bibliometric classificatory approach for the study and assessment of research performance at the individual level: The effects of age on productivity and impact (2010) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 61, pp. 1564-1581; Costas, R., Van Leeuwen, T.N., Bordons, M., Self-citations at the meso and individual levels: Effects of different calculation methods (2010) Scientometrics, 82 (3), pp. 517-537; Cronin, B., Weaver, S., The praxis of acknowledgements: From bibliometrics to influmetrics (1995) Revista Española de Documentaciõn Científica, 18 (2), pp. 172-177; Galligan, F., Dyas-Correia, S., Altmetrics: Rethinking the way we measure (2013) Serials Review, 39 (1), pp. 56-61; Groth, P., Gurney, T., Studying scientific discourse on the Web using bibliometrics: A chemistry blogging case study (2010) WebSci10: Extending the Frontiers of Society On-Line, , http://wiki.few.vu.nl/sms/images/9/9c/Websci10-FINAL-29-4-2010f.pdf, Presented at the.

The authors therefore conducted a retrospective review to survey the practice of reporting participation in epidemiologic studies, to assess changes in participation over time, and to evaluate the impact of increased biologic specimen collection on participation. The authors abstracted selected study characteristics from 355 peer-reviewed, original, analytic-epidemiology research articles published from January 1 to April 30, 2003, in 10 high-impact general epidemiology, public health, and medical journals. At least some information regarding participation was provided in 59% of cross-sectional studies, 44% of case-control studies, and 32% of cohort studies. Participation appears to have declined during 1970-2003 for all study designs. Participation declined most steeply for controls in population-based, case-control studies (-1.86% per year, 95% confidence interval: -3.03, -0.69), with steeper declines after 1990. Proportionately more studies collected biologic specimens over time, particularly for cohort and case-control study designs (ptrend = 0.06 and 0.03, respectively), yet participation was reported separately for the biologic specimen study component in only 27% of studies. The authors conclude that epidemiologists need to address declining participation and to report participation consistently, including for biologic specimen collection.

We demonstrate how two software tools, CitNetExplorer and VOSviewer, can be used to cluster publications and to analyze the resulting clustering solutions. CitNetExplorer is used to cluster a large set of publications in the field of astronomy and astrophysics. The publications are clustered based on direct citation relations. CitNetExplorer and VOSviewer are used together to analyze the resulting clustering solutions. Both tools use visualizations to support the analysis of the clustering solutions, with CitNetExplorer focusing on the analysis at the level of individual publications and VOSviewer focusing on the analysis at an aggregate level. The demonstration provided in this paper shows how a clustering of publications can be created and analyzed using freely available software tools. Using the approach presented in this paper, bibliometricians are able to carry out sophisticated cluster analyses without the need to have a deep knowledge of clustering techniques and without requiring advanced computer skills. © 2017, The Author(s).",Citation; CitNetExplorer; Clustering; VOSviewer,,"Blondel, V.D., Guillaume, J.-L., Lambiotte, R., Lefebvre, E., Fast unfolding of communities in large networks (2008) Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment, 10, p.

Its main objectives are: to identify the different theoretical perspectives and research streams that characterize and define the co-creation literature, and to highlight the connections between them; to look for emerging trends and gaps in the literature by comparing the most recent papers with those representing the field’s core.Design/methodology/approach – The paper relies on bibliometric data: co-citation techniques were employed to select, analyze, and interpret citation patterns within the co-creation literature.Findings – The paper identified two main clusters, as well as specific research streams and common themes, representing scholarly journals’ publications on co-creation over the past years. These research streams and themes apply three different theoretical perspectives: service science, innovation and technology management, and marketing and consumer research. Data from the most recent publications has been used to verify if and how the original streams and themes are reflected in the contemporary debate.Research limitations/implications – Inevitably, the findings of the analysis have limitations related to the research design, the databases, and the applied bibliometric methods.Practical implications – From a practical perspective, the research impacts on theory building, management decision making, and teaching.Originality/value – This study depicts the remarkable development of the literature on co-creation and shows the latent structure underlying its different research streams. To the best knowledge, this study is the first to determine co-citation frequencies from both the SSCI and Scopus databases. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Co-citation analysis; Co-creation; Customer participation; Service dominant logic; Service science; Value,,"Acedo, F.J., Casillas, J.C., Current paradigms in the international management field: An author co-citation analysis (2005) International Business Review, 14 (5), pp. 619-639; Acedo, F.J., Barroso, C., Galan, J.L., The resource-based theory: Dissemination and main trends (2006) Strategic Management Journal, 27 (7), pp. 621-636; Alavi, S., Ahuja, V., Medury, Y., Metcalfe's law and operational, analytical and collaborative CRM-using online business communities for co-creation (2012) Journal of Targeting, Measurement & Analysis for Marketing, 20 (1), pp. 35-45; Andreu, L., Sánchez, I., Mele, C., Value co-creation among retailers and consumers: New insights into the furniture market (2010) Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 17 (4), pp. 241-250; Arnould, E.J., Animating the big middle (2005) Journal of Retailing, 81 (2), pp. 89-96; Arnould, E.J., Thompson, C.J., Consumer culture theory (CCT): Twenty years of research (2005) Journal of Consumer Research, 31 (4), pp. 868-882; Ballantyne, D., Varey, R.J., Creating value-in-use through marketing interaction: The exchange logic of relating, communicating and knowing (2006) Marketing Theory, 6 (3), pp. 335-348; Ballantyne, D., Varey, R.J., The service-dominant logic and the future of marketing (2008) Journal of the academy of Marketing Science, 36 (1), pp. 11-14; Belk, R., Wallendorf, M., Sherry, J.F., Jr., The sacred and the profane in consumer behavior: Theodicy on the odyssey (1989) Journal of Consumer Research, 16 (1), pp. 1-38; Bitner, M., Brown, S.W., Meuter, M.L., Technology infusion in service encounters (2000) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 28 (1), pp. 138-149; Bitner, M., Ostrom, A.L., Morgan, F.N., Service blueprinting: A practical technique for service innovation (2008) California Management Review, 50 (3), pp. 66-94; Bolton, R., Saxena-Iyer, S., Interactive services: A framework, synthesis and research directions (2009) Journal of Interactive Marketing, 23 (1), pp. 91-104; Bonsu, S.K., Darmody, A., Co-creating second life market-consumer cooperation in contemporary economy (2008) Journal of Macromarketing, 28 (4), pp. 355-368; Bowman, C., Ambrosini, V., Value creation versus value capture: Towards a coherent definition of value in strategy (2000) British Journal of Management, 11 (1), pp. 1-15; Boyack, K.W., Klavans, R., Co-citation analysis, bibliographic coupling, and direct citation: Which citation approach represents the research front most accurately?

Nicholson Research Lab, 219 Townsend Road, West Groton, MA 01472, United States","Gas diffusion layer (GDL) is one of the critical components acting both as the functional as well as the support structure for membrane-electrode assembly in the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The role of the GDL is very significant in the H2/air PEM fuel cell to make it commercially viable. A bibliometric analysis of the publications on the GDLs since 1992 shows a total of 400+ publications (&gt;140 papers in the Journal of Power Sources alone) and reveals an exponential growth due to reasons that PEMFC promises a lot of potential as the future energy source for varied applications and hence its vital component GDL requires due innovative analysis and research. This paper is an attempt to pool together the published work on the GDLs and also to review the essential properties of the GDLs, the method of achieving each one of them, their characterization and the current status and future directions. The optimization of the functional properties of the GDLs is possible only by understanding the role of its key parameters such as structure, porosity, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, gas permeability, transport properties, water management and the surface morphology. This paper discusses them in detail to provide an insight into the structural parts that make the GDLs and also the processes that occur in the GDLs under service conditions and the characteristic properties. The required balance in the properties of the GDLs to facilitate the counter current flow of the gas and water is highlighted through its characteristics. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The paper describes various types of information added to the database: data on articles citing the Dutch publications; detailed citation data on ISI journals and subfields; and a classification system of publishing main organizations, appearing in the addresses. Moreover, an overview is given of the types of bibliometric indicators that were constructed. Their relationship to indicators developed by other researchers in the field is discussed. Finally, two applications are given in order to illustrate the potentials of the database and of the bibliometric indicators derived from it. The first represents a synthesis of 'classical' macro indicator studies at the one hand, and bibliometric analyses of research groups or institutes at the other. The second application gives for the first time a detailed analysis of a country's publication output per institutional sector. © 1995 Akadémiai Kiadó.",,,"Moed, H.F., de Bruin, R.E., Beerens, J., Schoneveld, J.A., Vriend, I., (1992) A Bibliometric System for the Assessment of National Research Performance: Database Description and First Application, , Research Report to the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, Report CWTS 92-03, Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS), Leiden; de Bruin, R.E., Moed, H.F., Schoneveld, J.A., (1992) Scientific Cooperation between the Public and Private Sector in the Netherlands (1980–1989), , Report prepared for the Netherlands Ministry of Education and Science, Report CWTS 92-04, Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS), Leiden; Moed, H.F., van der Velde, J.G.M., (1993) Bibliometric Profiles of Academic Chemistry Research in the Netherlands, , Research Report to the Netherlands Foundation for Chemical Research (SON), and to the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), CWTS, Report CWTS 93-08, Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden; Moed, H.F., Ramaekers, A.M.P.H., Bibliometric Profiles of Academic Biology Research in the Netherlands (1994) Netherlands Biology in the Nineties, , Association of Universities in the Netherlands (VSNU), Utrecht; H.

We propose a conceptual framework that aims to capture interdisciplinarity in the wider sense of knowledge integration, by exploring the concepts of diversity and coherence. Disciplinary diversity indicators are developed to describe the heterogeneity of a bibliometric set viewed from predefined categories, i.e. using a top-down approach that locates the set on the global map of science. Network coherence indicators are constructed to measure the intensity of similarity relations within a bibliometric set, i.e. using a bottom-up approach, which reveals the structural consistency of the publications network. We carry out case studies on individual articles in bionanoscience to illustrate how these two perspectives identify different aspects of interdisciplinarity: disciplinary diversity indicates the large-scale breadth of the knowledge base of a publication; network coherence reflects the novelty of its knowledge integration. We suggest that the combination of these two approaches may be useful for comparative studies of emergent scientific and technological fields, where new and controversial categorisations are accompanied by equally contested claims of novelty and interdisciplinarity. © 2009 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Diversity; Indicators; Interdisciplinary research; Nanoscience; Nanotechnology; Network analysis,,"Ahlgren, P., Jarneving, B., Rousseau, R., Requirement for a cocitation similarity measure, with special reference to Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (2003) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 54 (6), pp. 550-560; Barjak, F., (2006) Team Diversity and Research Collaboration in Life Sciences Teams: Does a Combination of Research Cultures Pay off?, , Olten, Switzerland: University of Applied Sciences Northwestern; Batagelj, V., Mrvar, A., (2008) Pajek.

The interaction within the research team is highlighted, showing the feelings and conditions which encompass the teamwork. The empirical findings are conceptualized in a model where research collaboration is suggested to be understood as dependent on how the reasons, forms and effects respectively vary. The collaborations are characterized by strong pragmatism and a high degree of self-organization. Finally, the science policy implications of this study are discussed.

In many cases, a similarity measure is employed to normalize the data. However, there is no consensus among researchers on which similarity measure is most appropriate for normalization purposes. In this article, we theoretically analyze the properties of similarity measures for cooccurrence data, focusing in particular on four well-known measures: the association strength, the cosine, the inclusion index, and the Jaccard index. We also study the behavior of these measures empirically. Our analysis reveals that there exist two fundamentally different types of similarity measures, namely, set-theoretic measures and probabilistic measures. The association strength is a probabilistic measure, while the cosine, the inclusion index, and the Jaccard index are set-theoretic measures. Both our theoretical and our empirical results indicate that cooccurrence data can best be normalized using a probabilistic measure. This provides strong support for the use of the association strength in scientometric research. © 2009 ASIS&T.",,Co-occurrence; Empirical results; Inclusion index; Jaccard index; Probabilistic measures; Scientometric; Similarity measure; Research,"Ahlgren, P., Jarneving, B., Rousseau, R., Requirements for a coc-itation similarity measure, with special reference to Pearson's correlation coefficient (2003) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 54 (6), pp. 550-560; Anderberg, M.R., (1973) Cluster analysis for applications, , New York: Academic Press; Baulieu, F.B., A classification of presence/absence based dissimilarity coefficients (1989) Journal of Classification, 6 (1), pp. 233-246; Baulieu, F.B., Two variant axiom systems for presence/absence based dissimilarity coefficients (1997) Journal of Classification, 14 (1), pp. 159-170; Borg, I., Groenen, P.J.F., (2005) Modern multidimensional scaling, , 2nd ed, Springer; Boyack, K.W., Klavans, R., Borner, K., Mapping the backbone of science (2005) Scientometrics, 64 (3), pp. 351-374; Braam, R.R., Moed, H.F., Van Raan, A.F.J., Mapping of science by combined co-citation and word analysis.

However, there is limited knowledge about the relative citation impact of articles using various study designs. Objective: To determine whether the type of study design affects the rate of citation in subsequent articles. Design and Setting: We measured the citation impact of articles using various study designs - including meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, case reports, nonsystematic reviews, and decision analysis or cost-effectiveness analysis - published in 1991 and in 2001 for a sample of 2646 articles. Main Outcome Measure: The citation count through the end of the second year after the year of publication and the total received citations. Results: Meta-analyses received more citations than any other study design both in 1991 (P<.05 for all comparisons) and in 2001 (P<.001 for all comparisons) and both in the first 2 years and in the longer term. More than 10 citations in the first 2 years were received by 32.4% of meta-analyses published in 1991 and 43.6% of meta-analyses published in 2001. Randomized controlled trials did not differ significantly from epidemiological studies and nonsystematic review articles in 1991 but clearly became the second-cited study design in 2001. Epidemiological studies, nonsystematic review articles, and decision and cost-effectiveness analyses had relatively similar impact; case reports received negligible citations. Meta-analyses were cited significantly more often than all other designs after adjusting for year of publication, high journal impact factor, and country of origin. When limited to studies addressing treatment effects, meta-analyses received more citations than randomized trials. Conclusion: Overall, the citation impact of various study designs is commensurate with most proposed hierarchies of evidence.",,article; case control study; case report; clinical trial; cohort analysis; controlled clinical trial; cost effectiveness analysis; decision making; health science; meta analysis; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; systematic review; bibliometrics; medical research; methodology; publishing; statistics; Bibliometrics; Biomedical Research; Publishing; Research Design,"West, S., King, V., Carey, T.S., (2002) Systems to Rate the Strength of Scientific Evidence, pp. 64-88. , Rockville, Md: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; AHRQ publication 02-E016; Harbour, R., Miller, J., A new system for grading recommendations in evidence based guidelines (2001) BMJ, 323, pp. 334-336; Phillips, B., Ball, C., Sackett, D., Levels of Evidence and Grades of Recommendations, , http://www.cebm.net/levels_of_evidence.asp, Oxford, England: Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine; Atkins, D., Best, D., Briss, P.A., Grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations (2004) BMJ, 328, p. 1490; Mulrow, C.D., The medical review article: State of the science (1987) Ann Intern Med, 106, pp. 485-488; Antman, E.M., Lau, J., Kupelnick, B., Mosteller, F., Chalmers, T.C., A comparison of results of meta-analyses of randomized control trials and recommendations of clinical experts: Treatments for myocardial infarction (1992) JAMA, 268, pp. 240-248; McAlister, F.A., Clark, H.D., Van Walraven, C., The medical review article revisited: Has the science improved?

However, scientific activity has moved online over the past decade. To better capture scientific impact in the digital era, a variety of new impact measures has been proposed on the basis of social network analysis and usage log data. Here we investigate how these new measures relate to each other, and how accurately and completely they express scientific impact. Methodology: We performed a principal component analysis of the rankings produced by 39 existing and proposed measures of scholarly impact that were calculated on the basis of both citation and usage log data. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the notion of scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct that can not be adequately measured by any single indicator, although some measures are more suitable than others. The commonly used citation Impact Factor is not positioned at the core of this construct, but at its periphery, and should thus be used with caution.",,"article; cluster analysis; data analysis; information processing; mathematical phenomena; principal component analysis; publication; scientific literature; social network; access to information; bibliometrics; factual database; information dissemination; journal impact factor; principal component analysis; publishing; standard; Access to Information; Bibliometrics; Databases, Factual; Information Dissemination; Journal Impact Factor; Periodicals as Topic; Principal Component Analysis; Publishing","Garfield, E., Journal impact factor: A brief review (1999) Canadian Medical Association Journal, 161, pp. 979-980; Opthof, T., Sense and nonsense about the impact factor (1997) Cardiovascular Research, 33, pp. 1-7; Seglen, P.O., Why the impact factor of journals should not be used for evaluating research (1997) British Medical Journal, pp. 314-497; Harter, S.P., Nisonger, T.E., ISI's impact factor as misnomer: A proposed new measure to assess journal impact (1997) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 48, pp. 1146-1148; Bordons, M., Fernandez, M.T., Gomez, I., Advantages and limitations in the use of impact factor measures for the assessment of research performance (2002) Scientometrics, 53, pp. 195-206; PLoS Medicine (eds) (2006) The impact factor game.

Biostatist., McMaster University, Canada","Purpose: The contingent valuation method (CVM) is a survey-based approach for eliciting consumer's monetary valuations for programme benefits for use in cost-benefit analysis (CBA). We used the conceptual framework of O'Brien and Gafni (1996) to classify and critically appraise health care CVM studies. Methods: Search of computerized health care and economic citation databases (e.g. MEDLINE, ECONLIT) and manual search for papers published between 1984-1996 reporting primary data valuing health programme benefits in monetary units by CVM using willingness-to-pay (WTP) or accept (WTA). We classified studies using both empirical (i.e. who was surveyed and how) and conceptual criteria (i.e. which measure of consumer utility was measured and why). Results: 48 CVM studies were retrieved; the majority (42) undertook money valuation in the context of cost benefit analysis (CBA), with the remainder being pricing/demand studies. Among the 42 CBA studies, the consumer utility being measured (i.e. compensating (CV) vs. equivalent variation (EV) was explicitly stated in only three (7%) studies). WTP was measured in 95% of studies and WTA in 5%. By cross-tabulation, 42 (91%) studies were designed as WTP/CV, two (4%) were WTP/EV, two (4%) were WTA/CV and no studies used WTA/EV. Most studies were administered by mail (52%) with 38% being in-person interviews. Value elicitation techniques included open-ended questions (38%), payment cards (19%) discrete choice questions (26%) or bidding games (29%). Some form of construct validation tests, particularly associations between WTP and income, were done in 21 studies (50%). Conclusions: (i) The number of health care CVM studies is growing rapidly and the majority are done in the context of CBA; (ii) there is wide variation among health care CVM studies in terms of the types of questions being posed and the elicitation formats being used; (iii) classification and appraisal of the literature is difficult because reporting of methods and their relationship with the conceptual framework of CBA is poor; (iii) the applicability to health care of the CVM guidelines issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) panel for environmental economics is unclear.",Contingent valuation method; Cost-benefit analysis; Health care,article; consumer; cost benefit analysis; data base; health care cost; health care quality; interview; priority journal; Attitude to Health; Bibliometrics; Consumer Satisfaction; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Databases; Health Care Surveys; Health Services Needs and Demand; Health Services Research; Questionnaires; Social Values,"Johannesson, M., The contingent valuation method - Appraising the appraisers (1993) Health Economics, 2, pp. 357-359; Mishan, E.J., (1971) Cost-benefit Analysis, , London: Allen and Unwin; Gafni, A., Willingness-to-pay as a measure of benefits.

We address this need using oaDOI, an open online service that determines OA status for 67 million articles. We use three samples, each of 100,000 articles, to investigateOAin three populations: (1) all journal articles assigned a Crossref DOI, (2) recent journal articles indexed in Web of Science, and (3) articles viewed by users of Unpaywall, an open-source browser extension that lets users find OA articles using oaDOI. We estimate that at least 28% of the scholarly literature is OA (19M in total) and that this proportion is growing, driven particularly by growth in Gold and Hybrid. The most recent year analyzed (2015) also has the highest percentage of OA (45%). Because of this growth, and the fact that readers disproportionately access newer articles, we find that Unpaywall users encounter OA quite frequently: 47% of articles they view are OA. Notably, the most common mechanism for OA is not Gold, Green, or Hybrid OA, but rather an under-discussed category we dub Bronze: articles made freeto- read on the publisher website, without an explicit Open license. We also examine the citation impact of OA articles, corroborating the so-called open-access citation advantage: accounting for age and discipline, OA articles receive 18% more citations than average, an effect driven primarily by Green and Hybrid OA. Weencourage further research using the free oaDOI service, as a way to inform OA policy and practice. © 2018 Piwowar et al.",Bibliometrics; Libraries; Open access; Open science; Publishing; Scholarly communication; Science policy; Scientometrics,access to information; Article; citation analysis; consensus development; information service; licence; medical research; publication; publishing; random sample; scientific literature; social network; software,"(2017) When the wolf finally arrives: big deal cancelations in North American Libraries, , https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/05/01/wolf-finally-arrives-big-deal-cancelations-north-american-libraries/, The Scholarly Kitchen (accessed on 09 January 2018); (2017) The forbidden forecast: thinking about open access and library subscriptions, , https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/02/21/forbidden-forecast-thinking-open-access-library-subscriptions/, The Scholarly Kitchen (accessed on 15 July 2017); Antelman, K., Leveraging the growth of open access in library collection decision making (2017) Proceeding from ACRL 2017, , http://www.ala.org/acrl/sites/ala.org.acrl/files/content/conferences/confsandpreconfs/2017/LeveragingtheGrowthofOpenAccess.pdf, at the helm: leading transformation; Archambault, É., Amyot, D., Deschamps, P., Nicol, A., Provencher, F., Rebout, L., Roberge, G., (2013) Proportion of open access peer-reviewed papers at the European and world levels-2004-2011, , http://www.science-metrix.com/pdf/SM_EC_OA_Availability_2004-2011.pdf, European Commission, Brussels; Archambault, É., Amyot, D., Deschamps, P., Nicol, A.F., Provencher, F., Rebout, L., Roberge, G., (2014) Proportion of open access papers published in peer-reviewed journals at the European and world levels-1996-2013, , http://science-metrix.com/sites/default/files/science-metrix/publications/d_1.8_sm_ec_dg-rtd_proportion_oa_1996-2013_v11p.pdf, European Commission; Archambault, É., Côté, G., Struck, B., Voorons, M., (2016) Research impact of paywalled versus open access papers, , https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1028&context=scholcom; Berg, J., (2010) Measuring the scientific output and impact of NIGMS grants, , https://loop.nigms.nih.gov/2010/09/measuring-the-scientific-output-and-impact-of-nigms-grants/, NIGMS Feedback Loop Blog [Blog post]; Björk, B., Hybrid open access-a longitudinal study (2016) Journal of Informetrics, 10 (4), pp. 919-932; Björk, B.-C., The open access movement at a crossroad: are the big publishers and academic social media taking over?

Box 7, Budapest, H-1361, Hungary","Cross-field comparison of scientometric indicators1 is severely hindered by the differences in publication and citation habits of science fields. However, relating publication and citation indicators to proper field-specific reference standards, relative indicators can be built, which may prove rather useful in the comparative assessment of scientists, groups, institutions or countries. The use of relational charts in displaying the indicators broadens the scope of such assessments. Relative indicators of chemistry research in 25 countries are presented as an illustrative example. © 1986 Akadémiai Kiadó.",,,"Braun, T., Glänzel, W., Schubert, A., (1985) Scientometric Indicators.

This study adopts a novel approach by combining two complementary bibliometric methods of co-citation analysis and text mining of 321 journal articles on OI that enables a robust empirical analysis of the intellectual streams and key concepts underpinning OI. Results reveal that researchers do not sufficiently draw on theoretical perspectives external to the field to examine multiple facets of OI. Research also seems confined to innovation-specific journals with its focus restricted to a select few OI issues, thereby exerting limited influence on the wider business community. This study reveals three distinct areas within OI research: (1) firm-centric aspects of OI, (2) management of OI networks, and (3) role of users and communities in OI. Thus far, studies have predominantly investigated the firm-centric aspects of OI, with a particular focus on the role of knowledge, technology, and R&D from the innovating firm's perspective, while the other two areas remain relatively under-researched. Further gaps in the literature emerge that present avenues for future research, namely to: (1) develop a more comprehensive understanding of OI by including diverse perspectives (users, networks, and communities), (2) direct increased attention to OI strategy formulation and implementation, and (3) enhance focus on customer co-creation and conceptualize “open service innovation.” Marketing (e.g., service-dominant logic), organizational behavior (e.g., communities of practice), and management (e.g., dynamic capabilities) offer suitable theoretical lenses and/or concepts to address these gaps. © 2016 Product Development & Management Association",,Commerce; Data mining; Information analysis; Marketing; Business community; Co-Citation Analysis; Communities of Practice; Customer co creations; Dynamic capabilities; Organizational behavior; Service-dominant Logic; Strategy formulations; Innovation,"Acedo, F.J., Casillas, J.C., Current paradigms in the international management field: An author co-citation analysis (2005) International Business Review, 14 (5), pp. 619-639; Afuah, A., (2009) Strategic innovation: New game strategies for competitive advantage, , New York, Routledge; Afuah, A., Are network effects really all about size?

The main objective of this paper is twofold, namely first to analyse if the number or weight of actors in scientific communication has increased, if patterns of documented scientific communication and collaboration have changed in the last two decades and if these tendencies have inflationary features. The second question is concerned with the role of scientific collaboration in this context. In particular, the question will be answered to what extent co-authorship and publication activity, on one hand, and co-authorship and citation impact, on the other hand, do interact. The answers found to these questions have strong implication for the application of bibliometric indicators in research evaluation, moreover, the construction of indicators applied to trend analyses and studies based on medium-term or long-term observations have to be reconsidered to guarantee the validity of conclusions drawn from bibliometric results.",,,"Braun, T., Glänzel, W., Schubert, Publication and cooperation patterns of the authors of neuroscience journals (2001) Scientometrics, 51 (3), pp. 499-510; Ding, Y., Foo, S., Chowdhury, G., A bibliometric analysis of collaboration in the field of information retrieval (1999) The International Information & Library Review, 30, pp. 367-376; Glänzel, W., De Lange, C., Modelling and measuring multilateral co-authorship in international scientific collaboration.

While the social structures of ""science"" and ""technology"" are distinctive, recent work suggests that scientific and technological ideas in fact co-evolve. This paper addresses the dynamics of such co-evolution: are scientific networks deeply co-mingled with networks through which technology is created and if so how? It does so in a study of an emerging area of biomedicine-tissue engineering. The research is based on a novel methodology that takes advantage of the fact that an idea is often inscribed in both a patent and paper, thus forming a patentpaper pair. Starting with the pair, it is possible to trace the citation network of patents, papers, inventors and authors, combining traditional bibliometric analysis with in-depth interviews to provide new insights. The results show that for this case there exist distinctive scientific and technological networks. Furthermore, while there is evidence of overlap, it is neither co-publishing nor citation as might be predicted from current literature. Rather co-mingling exists through founding, licensing, consulting and advising. This has implications for our understanding of the processes through which spillovers arise, the way in which commercialization and technology transfer should be structured and for recent debates on conflict of interest in biomedicine. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We analyzed how 2286 publications between 1967 and 2005 are related in terms of co-authorship relations, and citation relations. The number of publications in the three knowledge domains increased rapidly between 1995 and 2005. However, the resilience knowledge domain is only weakly connected with the other two domains in terms of co-authorships and citations. The resilience knowledge domain has a background in ecology and mathematics with a focus on theoretical models, while the vulnerability and adaptation knowledge domains have a background in geography and natural hazards research with a focus on case studies and climate change research. There is an increasing number of cross citations and papers classified in multiple knowledge domains. This seems to indicate an increasing integration of the different knowledge domains. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Important aspects of IoT in SCM are covered including IoT definition, main IoT technology enablers and various SCM processes and applications. We offer several categorisation of the extant literature, such as based on methodology, industry sector and focus on a classification based on major supply chain processes. In addition, a bibliometric analysis of the literature is also presented. We find that most studies have focused on conceptualising the impact of IoT with limited analytical models and empirical studies. In addition, most studies have focused on the delivery supply chain process and the food and manufacturing supply chains. Areas of future SCM research that can support IoT implementation are also identified. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",industry 4.0; Internet of Things (IoT); smart supply chain; supply chain management; supply chain processes,Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Bibliometric analysis; Empirical studies; Industry sectors; Internet of Things (IOT); Literature reviews; Supply chain managements (SCM); Supply chain process; Supply chain management,"Agrawal, S., Lal Das, M., Internet of Things–A Paradigm Shift of Future Internet Applications (2011) 2011 Nirma University International Conference on Engineering, , Ahmedabad, India:, and,.

Objective: The aim of this study is to systematically review studies on the incidence and prevalence of the main specific RRMIs. Methods: An electronic database search was conducted using EMBASE (1947 to October 2011), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2011), SPORTDiscus (1975 to October 2011), the Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information (LILACS) [1982 to October 2011] and the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) [1998 to October 2011] with no limits of date or language of publication. Articles that described the incidence or prevalence rates of RRMIs were considered eligible. Studies that reported only the type of injury, anatomical region or incomplete data that precluded interpretation of the incidence or prevalence rates of RRMIs were excluded. We extracted data regarding bibliometric characteristics, study design, description of the population of runners, RRMI definition, how the data of RRMIs were collected and the name of each RRMI with their rates of incidence or prevalence. Separate analysis for ultra-marathoners was performed. Among 2924 potentially eligible titles, eight studies (pooled n = 3500 runners) were considered eligible for the review. In general, the articles had moderate risk of bias and only one fulfilled less than half of the quality criteria established. Results: A total of 28 RRMIs were found and the main general RRMIs were medial tibial stress syndrome (incidence ranging from 13.6% to 20.0%; prevalence of 9.5%), Achilles tendinopathy (incidence ranging from 9.1% to 10.9%; prevalence ranging from 6.2% to 9.5%) and plantar fasciitis (incidence ranging from 4.5% to 10.0%; prevalence ranging from 5.2% to 17.5%). The main ultra-marathon RRMIs were Achilles tendinopathy (prevalence ranging from 2.0% to 18.5%) and patellofemoral syndrome (prevalence ranging from 7.4% to 15.6%). Conclusion: This systematic review provides evidence that medial tibia stress syndrome, Achilles tendinopathy and plantar fasciitis were the main general RRMIs, while Achilles tendinopathy and patellofemoral syndrome were the most common RRMIs for runners who participated in ultra-marathon races. © 2012 Springer International Publishing AG.

Lyngby, Denmark","The problem of incomplete data - i.e., data with missing or unknown values - in multi-way arrays is ubiquitous in biomedical signal processing, network traffic analysis, bibliometrics, social network analysis, chemometrics, computer vision, communication networks, etc. We consider the problem of how to factorize data sets with missing values with the goal of capturing the underlying latent structure of the data and possibly reconstructing missing values (i.e., tensor completion). We focus on one of the most well-known tensor factorizations that captures multi-linear structure, CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP). In the presence of missing data, CP can be formulated as a weighted least squares problem that models only the known entries. We develop an algorithm called CP-WOPT (CP Weighted OPTimization) that uses a first-order optimization approach to solve the weighted least squares problem. Based on extensive numerical experiments, our algorithm is shown to successfully factorize tensors with noise and up to 99% missing data. A unique aspect of our approach is that it scales to sparse large-scale data, e.g., 1000 × 1000 × 1000 with five million known entries (0.5% dense). We further demonstrate the usefulness of CP-WOPT on two real-world applications: a novel EEG (electroencephalogram) application where missing data is frequently encountered due to disconnections of electrodes and the problem of modeling computer network traffic where data may be absent due to the expense of the data collection process. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",CANDECOMP; Incomplete data; Missing data; Optimization; PARAFAC; Tensor factorization,algorithm; article; CANDECOMP analysis; computer model; computer network; controlled study; data analysis; data collection method; electroencephalogram; latent structure analysis; mathematical and statistical procedures; mathematical computing; PARAFAC analysis; priority journal; regression analysis; scalable tensor factorization; simulation,"Acar, E., Dunlavy, D.M., Kolda, T.G., Mørup, M., Scalable Tensor Factorizations with Missing Data (2010) Proceedings of the Tenth SIAM International Conference on Data Mining, pp. 701-712. , http://www.siam.org/proceedings/datamining/2010/dm10_061_acare.pdf, SIAM, URL; Zhang, Y., Roughan, M., Willinger, W., Qiu, L., Spatio-temporal compressive sensing and internet traffic matrices (2009) SIGCOMM '09: Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM 2009 conference on Data communication, pp. 267-278. , ACM, New York, NY, USA; Buchanan, A.M., Fitzgibbon, A.W., Damped Newton algorithms for matrix factorization with missing data (2005) CVPR'05: 2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2, pp. 316-322. , IEEE Computer Society; Acar, E., Yener, B., Unsupervised multiway data analysis: a literature survey (2009) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 21 (1), pp. 6-20; Kolda, T.G., Bader, B.W., Tensor decompositions and applications (2009) SIAM Review, 51 (3), pp. 455-500; Miwakeichi, F., Martínez-Montes, E., Valdés-Sosa, P.A., Nishiyama, N., Mizuhara, H., Yamaguchi, Y., Decomposing EEG data into space-time-frequency components using parallel factor analysis (2004) NeuroImage, 22 (3), pp. 1035-1045; Tomasi, G., Bro, R., PARAFAC and missing values (2005) Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems, 75 (2), pp. 163-180; Orekhov, V.Y., Ibraghimov, I., Billeter, M., Optimizing resolution in multidimensional NMR by three-way decomposition (2003) Journal of Biomolecular NMR, 27, pp. 165-173; Geng, X., Smith-Miles, K., Zhou, Z.-H., Wang, L., Face Image Modeling by Multilinear Subspace Analysis with Missing Values (2009) MM '09: Proceedings of the seventeen ACM international conference on Multimedia, pp. 629-632. , ACM; Ruhe, A., Numerical Computation of Principal Components when Several Observations are Missing (1974) Tech.

In the work reported here, for the Commission of the European Communities, CHI has extended the Science Indicators techniques and database to a study of publication, coauthorship and citation within 28 scientific fields related to various European Community programs. Perhaps the most important finding of the research was that internationally coauthored papers - papers authored by scientists affiliated with institutions in more than one EC country - were cited two times as highly as papers authored by scientists working at a single institution within a single country. These EC-EC internationally coauthored papers were cited as highly as EC-Non EC and Non-EC papers. This indicates that the internationally linked European science is of as high impact as any other science in the world. A second key finding was that, after compensating for national scientific size, the degree of international coauthorship did not appear to be particularly dependent upon size. However, linguistic and cultural factors were found to be very strong. The patterns of coauthorship amongst the European countries are far from homogeneous, and are quite heavily affected by linguistic, historical, and cultural factors. Finally, it was found that international coauthorship is increasing steadily, both within and outside of the Community, with some evidence that international cooperation is increasing more rapidly in scientific fields that have been targeted by the Commission. © 1991 Akadémiai Kiadó.",,,"F.

In this study bibliometric indicators were calculated for all research groups in the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the University of Leiden. Bibliometric results were discussed with a number of researchers from the two faculties involved. Our main conclusion is that the use of bibliometric data for evaluation purposes carries a number of problems, both with respect to data collection and handling, and with respect to the interpretation of bibliometric results. However, most of these problems can be overcome. When used properly, bibliometric indicators can provide a ""monitoring device"" for university research-management and science policy. They enable research policy-makers to ask relevant questions of researchers on their scientific performance, in order to find explanations of the bibliometric results in terms of factors relevant to policy. © 1985.",,,"van Raan, Frankfort, An Approach to University Science Policy: A New Research Funding System (1980) International Journal of Institutional Management in Higher Education, 4, pp. 155-163; Martin, Irvine, Assessing Basic Research: Some Partical Indicators of Scientific Progress in Radio Astronomy (1983) Research Policy, 12, pp. 61-90; Moed, Burger, Frankfort, van Raan, (1983) On the Measurement of Research Performance: the Use of Bibliometric Indicators, , Research Policy Unit of the University of Leiden, Leiden; Chang, Evaluation and survey of a Subfield of Physics: Magnetic Resonance and Relaxation Studies in The Netherlands (1975) FOM Report 37175, , FOM, Utrecht; Over Leven (1982) Report of the Verkenningscommissie Biochemie, , National Survey Committee on Biochemistry, Staatsuitgeverij, The Hague, (in Dutch)","Moed, H.F.; Research Policy and Science Studies Unit, Bureau Universiteit, University of Leiden, P.O.

Box 100131, D-33501, Bielefeld, Germany","The introduction of bibliometric (and other) ranking is an answer to legitimation pressures on the higher education and research system. After years of hesitation by scientists, science administrators and even politicians in many of the industrialized countries, the implementation of bibliometrics based (and other types of) rankings for institutions of higher education and research is now being introduced on a full scale. What used to be an irritation to the parties concerned has suddenly become a fad. In contrast to this rather sudden enthusiasm, there is very little reflection on the impacts of this practice on the system itself. So far empirical data on the impact of bibliometric rankings seem to be available only for two cases: Australia and the British research assessment exercise (RAE). Thus, the actual steering effects of bibliometric rankings, the reactions of the system are largely unknown. Rankings are in urgent demand by politics. The intended effect is to create competition among institutions of higher learning and research and thereby to increase their efficiency. The rankings are supposed to identify excellence in these institutions and among researchers. Unintended effects may be ""oversteering"", either by forcing less competitive institutions to be closed down or by creating oligopolies whose once achieved position of supremacy cannot be challenged anymore by competitors. On the individual level the emergence of a kind of 'chart' of highly cited stars in science can already be observed (ISI HighlyCited.com). With the spread of rankings the business administration paradigm and culture is diffused through the academic system. The commercialization of ranking is most pronounced in the dependence of the entire practice on commercial providers of the pertinent data. As products like ISI's Essential Science Indicators become available, their use in the context of evaluation tasks is increasing rapidly. The future of the higher education and research system rests on two pillars: traditional peer review and ranking. The goal must be to have a system of informed peer review which combines the two. However, the politicized use of numbers (citations, impact factors, funding etc.) appears unavoidable. Copyright © 2005 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.

We sought to compare the newly introduced SCImago journal rank (SJR) indicator with the journal impact factor (IF). We retrieved relevant information from the official Web sites hosting the above indices and their source databases. The SJR indicator is an open-access resource, while the journal IF requires paid subscription. The SJR indicator (based on Scopus data) lists considerably more journal titles published in a wider variety of countries and languages, than the journal IF (based on Web of Science data). Both indices divide citations to a journal by articles of the journal, during a specific time period. However, contrary to the journal IF, the SJR indicator attributes different weight to citations depending on the ""prestige"" of the citing journal without the influence of journal self-citations; prestige is estimated with the application of the PageRank algorithm in the network of journals. In addition, the SJR indicator includes the total number of documents of a journal in the denominator of the relevant calculation, whereas the journal IF includes only ""citable"" articles (mainly original articles and reviews). A 3-yr period is analyzed in both indices but with the use of different approaches. Regarding the top 100 journals in the 2006 journal IF ranking order, the median absolute change in their ranking position with the use of the SJR indicator is 32 (1st quartile: 12; 3rd quartile: 75). Although further validation is warranted, the novel SJR indicator poses as a serious alternative to the well-established journal IF, mainly due to its openaccess nature, larger source database, and assessment of the quality of citations. © FASEB.",Bibliographic databases; Bibliometric analysis; Mathematical computing; Quality of publications; Scientometrics,"article; citation analysis; intermethod comparison; mathematical model; medical information; online system; priority journal; scientific literature; validation study; Algorithms; Bibliometrics; Databases, Bibliographic; Periodicals as Topic; Scopus","Smith, R., Commentary: The power of the unrelenting impact factor-is it a force for good or harm?

The three concepts are currently mainstreamed in academia and policy making as key sustainability avenues, but a comparative analysis of such concepts is missing. The aim of this article is thus to comprehensively analyse the diversity within and between such concepts. The results are drawn from a bibliometric review of almost two thousand scientific articles published within the last three decades, coupled with a conceptual analysis. We find that, for what concerns environmental sustainability, Green Economy acts as an ‘umbrella' concept, including elements from Circular Economy and Bioeconomy concepts (e.g. eco-efficiency; renewables), as well as additional ideas, e.g. nature-based solutions. In particular, Circular Economy and Bioeconomy are resource-focused, whereas in principle Green Economy acknowledges the underpinning role of all ecological processes. Regarding the social dimension, Green Economy is more inclusive of some aspects at local level (e.g. eco-tourism, education), while there is an emerging discussion in Bioeconomy literature around local processes in terms of biosecurity and rural policies. When considering weak/strong sustainability visions, all concepts remain limited in questioning economic growth. By comparing the different sustainability strategies promoted by these concepts we do not advocate for their substitutability, but for their clarification and reciprocal integration.

We present an extensive comparison between the use of MDS and the use of VOS for constructing bibliometric maps. In our theoretical analysis, we show the mathematical relation between the two techniques. In our empirical analysis, we use the techniques for constructing maps of authors, journals, and keywords. Two commonly used approaches to bibliometric mapping, both based on MDS, turn out to produce maps that suffer from artifacts. Maps constructed using VOS turn out not to have this problem. We conclude that in general maps constructed using VOS provide a more satisfactory representation of a dataset than maps constructed using well-known MDS approaches. © 2010 ASIS&T.",,Bibliometric; Commonly used; Data sets; Empirical analysis; Mapping techniques; Mathematical relation; Multi-dimensional scaling; Mapping; Mathematical techniques,"Ahlgren, P., Jarneving, B., Rousseau, R., Requirements for a cocitation similarity measure, with special reference to Pearson's correlation coefficient (2003) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 54 (6), pp. 550-560; Aström, F., Changes in the LIS research front: Time-sliced cocitation analyses of LIS journal articles, 1990""2004 (2007) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 58 (7), pp. 947-957; Belkin, M., Niyogi, P., Laplacian eigenmaps for dimensionality reduction and data representation (2003) Neural Computation, 15 (6), pp. 1373-1396; Blatt, E.M., Differentiating, describing, and visualizing scientific space: A novel approach to the analysis of published scientific abstracts (2009) Scientometrics, 80 (2), pp. 387-408; Borg, I., Groenen, P.J.F., (2005) Modern Multidimensional Scaling, , (2nd ed.).

It is very useful for classifying information according to different variables, including journals, institutions and countries. This paper presents a general overview of research in the fuzzy sciences using bibliometric indicators. The main advantage is that these indicators provide a general picture, identifying some of the most influential research in this area. The analysis is divided into key sections focused on relevant journals, papers, authors, institutions and countries. Most of the results are in accordance with our common knowledge, although some unexpected results are also found. Note that the aim of this paper is to be informative, and these indicators identify most of the fundamental research in this field.

Box 7659, Winston-Salem, NC 27109, United States","Citation analysis combined with a network analysis of co-citation data from three major operations management (OM) journals is used to reveal the evolution of the intellectual structure of the OM field between 1980 and 2006. This spans the entire time since the beginning of research journals specific to the field. Employing a bibliometric citation/co-citation analysis to investigate the foundations of the discipline enables a robust, quantitative approach to uncovering the evolution of research in OM. The study finds that the intellectual structure of the field made statistically significant changes between the 1980s, the 1990s, and the 2000s and evolved from a pre-occupation with narrow, tactical topics toward more strategic, macrotopics, including new research methods and techniques. A factor analysis identifies the 12 top knowledge groups in the field and how they change over the decades. Illustrations of the structure of the co-citations representing the field are generated from a spring-embedded algorithm that is an improvement over the standard multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) approach to illustrating the knowledge groups. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It is centrally, but not only, concerned with the analysis of citations in the academic literature. In recent years it has come to play a major role in the measurement and evaluation of research performance. In this review we consider: the historical development of scientometrics, sources of citation data, citation metrics and the ""laws"" of scientometrics, normalisation, journal impact factors and other journal metrics, visualising and mapping science, evaluation and policy, and future developments. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) within the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).",Altmetrics; Citations; H-index; Impact factor; Normalisation,Operations research; Altmetrics; Citations; H indices; Impact factor; Normalisation; Mathematical models,"Aad, G., Abajyan, T., Abbott, B., Abdallah, J., Abdel Khalek, S., Observation of a new particle in the search for the Standard Model Higgs boson with the ATLAS detector at the LHC (2012) Physics Letters B, 716 (1), pp. 1-29; Abramo, G., D'Angelo, C., Evaluating research: From informed peer review to bibliometric (2011) Scientometrics, 87 (3), pp. 499-514; Abramo, G., D'Angelo, C., Di Costa, F., National research assessment exercises: A comparison of peer review and bibliometric rankings (2011) Scientometrics, 89, pp. 929-941; Adriaanse, L., Rensleigh, C., Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar (2013) The Electronic Library, 31 (6), pp. 727-744; Ahlgren, P., Jarneving, B., Rousseau, R., Requirements for a cocitation similarity measure, with special reference to Pearson's correlation coefficient (2003) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 54 (6), pp. 550-560; Aksnes, D.W., Schneider, J.W., Gunnarsson, M., Ranking national research systems by citation indicators.

Using publication and citation data, it compares the degree of interdisciplinarity and the research performance of a number of Innovation Studies units with that of leading Business & Management Schools (BMS) in the UK. On the basis of various mappings and metrics, this study shows that: (i) Innovation Studies units are consistently more interdisciplinary in their research than Business & Management Schools; (ii) the top journals in the Association of Business Schools' rankings span a less diverse set of disciplines than lower-ranked journals; (iii) this results in a more favourable assessment of the performance of Business & Management Schools, which are more disciplinary-focused. This citation-based analysis challenges the journal ranking-based assessment. In short, the investigation illustrates how ostensibly 'excellence-based' journal rankings exhibit a systematic bias in favour of mono-disciplinary research. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications of these phenomena, in particular how the bias is likely to affect negatively the evaluation and associated financial resourcing of interdisciplinary research organisations, and may result in researchers becoming more compliant with disciplinary authority over time. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Bibliometrics; Evaluation; Innovation; Interdisciplinary; Ranking; Research assessment,Bibliometrics; Evaluation; Interdisciplinarity; Interdisciplinary; Interdisciplinary research; Ranking; Research evaluation; Research performance; Engineering,"(1990) Peer Review: A Report to the Advisory Board for the Research Councils (ABRC) from the Working Group on Peer Review (Boden Report), , ABRC ABRC, London; (2010) Academic Journal Quality Guide.

Classification usually takes place at the level of journals, where the Web of Science subject categories are the most popular classification system. However, journal-level classification systems have two important limitations: They offer only a limited amount of detail, and they have difficulties with multidisciplinary journals. To avoid these limitations, we introduce a new methodology for constructing classification systems at the level of individual publications. In the proposed methodology, publications are clustered into research areas based on citation relations. The methodology is able to deal with very large numbers of publications. We present an application in which a classification system is produced that includes almost 10 million publications. Based on an extensive analysis of this classification system, we discuss the strengths and the limitations of the proposed methodology. Important strengths are the transparency and relative simplicity of the methodology and its fairly modest computing and memory requirements. The main limitation of the methodology is its exclusive reliance on direct citation relations between publications. The accuracy of the methodology can probably be increased by also taking into account other types of relations-for instance, based on bibliographic coupling. © 2012 ASIS&T.",bibliometrics; citation analysis,Bibliographic couplings; Bibliometric analysis; Bibliometrics; Citation analysis; Classification system; Essential elements; Memory requirements; Web of Science; Artificial intelligence; Software engineering; Publishing,"Ahlgren, P., Colliander, C., Document-document similarity approaches and science mapping: Experimental comparison of five approaches (2009) Journal of Informetrics, 3 (1), pp. 49-63; Archambault, E., Beauchesne, O.H., Caruso, J., Towards a multilingual, comprehensive and open scientific journal ontology (2011) Proceedings of the 13th International Conference of the International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics, pp. 66-77. , In E.C.M.

Centre-Ville, Montréal, QC H3C 3P8, Canada","For more than 40 years, the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI, now part of Thomson Reuters) produced the only available bibliographic databases from which bibliometricians could compile large-scale bibliometric indicators. ISIs citation indexes, now regrouped under the Web of Science (WoS), were the major sources of bibliometric data until 2004, when Scopus was launched by the publisher Reed Elsevier. For those who perform bibliometric analyses and comparisons of countries or institutions, the existence of these two major databases raises the important question of the comparability and stability of statistics obtained from different data sources. This paper uses macrolevel bibliometric indicators to compare results obtained from the WoS and Scopus. It shows that the correlations between the measures obtained with both databases for the number of papers and the number of citations received by countries, as well as for their ranks, are extremely high (R2 ≈ .99). There is also a very high correlation when countries' papers are broken down by field. The paper thus provides evidence that indicators of scientific production and citations at the country level are stable and largely independent of the database.",,Bibliographic database; Bibliometric analysis; Broken down; Data source; Elsevier; Institute for scientific informations; Reuters; Thomson; Web of Science; Information services; Regression analysis,"Archambault, É., Campbell, D., Gingras, Y., Larivière, V., WoS vs. Scopus: On the reliability of scientometrics (2008) Book of Abstracts of the 10th International Conference on Science and Technology Indicators, pp. 94-97. , Vienna: Austrian Research Centers GmbH; Bakkalbasi, N., Bauer, K., Glover, J., Wang, L., Three options for citation tracking: Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science (2006) Biomedical Digital Libraries, 3, p. 7. , http://www.bio-diglib.eom/content/3/l/7, Retrieved March 4, 2009; Ball, R., Tunger, D., Science indicators revisited - Science citation index versus SCOPUS: A bibliometric comparison of both citation databases (2006) Information Services and Use, 26 (4), pp. 293-301; Bar-Ilan, J., Which h-index?

Using bibliometric techniques, the authors examined 30 management journals to identify the 100 most-cited universities and 150 most-cited authors from 1981 to 2004. The analysis included more than 1,600 universities and 25,000 management scholars across five individual time periods. The findings showed that (a) a relatively small proportion of universities and scholars accounted for the majority of the citations in the field; (b) total publications accounted for the majority of the variance in university citations; (c) university size, the number of PhDs awarded, research expenditures, and endowment assets had the biggest impact on university publications; and (d) total publications, years in the field, graduate school reputation, and editorial board memberships had the biggest effect on a scholar's citations. © 2008 Southern Management Association.

Our objective was to identify and analyze the characteristics of the 100 most frequently cited articles published in journals dedicated to general surgery and its close subspecialties. Using the database (1945-1995) of the Science Citation Index of the Institute for Scientific Information, 1500 articles cited 100 times and more were identified and the top 100 articles selected for further analysis. The 100 articles were published between 1931 and 1990, with more than two-thirds of them published after 1960. The mean number of citations per article was 405, (range 278-1013). Altogether, 84 of the articles originated from North America (USA 78; Canada 6) and the UK (12). New York State led the list of U.S. states with 14, and Harvard and Columbia University led the list of institutions with 6 articles each. The 100 articles were published in 10 surgical journals led by the Annals of Surgery (n = 40), followed by Surgery (n = 15), Archives of Surgery (n = 12), Surgery, Gynecology and Obstetrics (n = 11), and British Journal of Surgery (n = 10). A total of 80 of the articles reported clinical experiences, 6 were clinical review articles, and 14 dealt with basic science. Eighteen articles reported a new surgical technique and six a prosthetic device. Gastrointestinal surgery and trauma and critical care led the list of the surgical fields, each with 25 articles, followed by vascular surgery (n = 15). Thirty-four persons authored two or more of the top-cited articles. This list of the top-cited papers identifies seminal contributions and their originators, facilitating the understanding and discourse of modern surgical history and offering surgeons hints about what makes a contribution a ""top-cited classic."" To produce such a ""classic"" the surgeon and his or her group must come up with a clinical or nonclinical innovation, observation, or discovery that has a long-standing effect on the way we practice - be it operative or nonoperative. Based on our findings, to be well cited such a contribution should be published in the English language in a high-impact journal. Moreover, it is more likely to resonant loudly if it originates from a North American or British ""ivory tower"".",,"article; bibliographic database; biomedicine; Canada; clinical observation; experience; gastrointestinal surgery; general surgery; history of medicine; medical literature; prosthesis; publication; SciSearch; surgical technique; United Kingdom; United States; vascular surgery; bibliographic database; bibliometrics; human; medical school; publication; statistics; writing; Authorship; Bibliometrics; Databases, Bibliographic; Humans; Periodicals; Schools, Medical","Garfield, E., 100 Citation classics from the Journal of the American Medical Association (1987) J.A.M.A., 257 (2), pp. 52-59; Dubin, D., Hafner, A.W., Arndt, K.A., Citation classics in clinical dermatologic journals: Citation analysis, biomedical journals, and landmark articles, 1945-1990 (1993) Arch.

Despite its importance, there is still no consensus on the definition or proper measurement of quality of life. Several concept analyses of quality of life have been published. However, they appear to have had a rather limited impact on how empirical studies are conducted. Therefore, we present an overview and critique of different conceptualisations of quality of life, with the ultimate goal of making quality of life a less ambiguous concept. We also describe six conceptual problems. These problems were used as criteria to evaluate the appropriateness of different conceptualisations. This evaluation suggests that defining quality of life in terms of life satisfaction is most appropriate, because this definition successfully deals with all the conceptual problems discussed. The result of our concept evaluation was not surprising for it corroborated the results of several concept analyses and the findings of a structural equation modelling study. Based on the findings revealed by our review, we propose that the scientific community should revitalise the conceptual discussion on quality of life. Furthermore, our findings can assist researchers in developing more rigourous quality-of-life research. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, as an area of study, emerging technologies lack key foundational elements, namely a consensus on what classifies a technology as 'emergent' and strong research designs that operationalise central theoretical concepts. The present paper aims to fill this gap by developing a definition of 'emerging technologies' and linking this conceptual effort with the development of a framework for the operationalisation of technological emergence. The definition is developed by combining a basic understanding of the term and in particular the concept of 'emergence' with a review of key innovation studies dealing with definitional issues of technological emergence. The resulting definition identifies five attributes that feature in the emergence of novel technologies. These are: (i) radical novelty, (ii) relatively fast growth, (iii) coherence, (iv) prominent impact, and (v) uncertainty and ambiguity. The framework for operationalising emerging technologies is then elaborated on the basis of the proposed attributes. To do so, we identify and review major empirical approaches (mainly in, although not limited to, the scientometric domain) for the detection and study of emerging technologies (these include indicators and trend analysis, citation analysis, co-word analysis, overlay mapping, and combinations thereof) and elaborate on how these can be used to operationalise the different attributes of emergence.",Attributes of emergence; Conceptualisation; Definition; Detection and analysis; Emerging technologies; Framework; Indicators; Operationalisation; Science and Technology Studies (STS); Scientometrics,Indicators (instruments); Innovation; Attributes of emergence; Conceptualisation; Definition; Emerging technologies; Framework; Operationalisation; Science and technology studies; Scientometrics; Information analysis,"Abercrombie, R.K., Udoeyop, A.W., Schlicher, B.G., A study of scientometric methods to identify emerging technologies via modeling of milestones (2012) Scientometrics, 91 (2), pp. 327-342; Adner, R., Levinthal, D., The emergence of emerging technologies (2002) Calif.

In this study, the extant literature published between 1994 and 2011 is analysed, using bibliometric methods in order to explore the scope of this approach and detect current research priorities. For this purpose, the method of bibliographic coupling is introduced in management research, which shifts the focus of analysis from past traditions to current trends. Several clusters of thematically related research are extracted from bibliographic networks, which represent interconnected yet distinct subfields of inquiry within the DCV. The core cluster of the current DCV, which visualizes this research field's nascent but fragile identity, focuses on learning and change capabilities and relates them to firm performance, thus merging aspects of organization theory and strategic management. In addition, several peripheral clusters of research are identified, which reflect a parallel process of differentiation in the overall field. Both trends, i.e. of integration and differentiation, attest to the emancipation of the DCV as a distinct approach to strategic management. However, the DCV still lacks consensual concepts that allow comparisons of empirical studies and advance the theoretical understanding of dynamic capabilities. In the light of the above, some implications of this analysis for further research are discussed. © 2012 British Academy of Management and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,"Acedo, F.J., Barroso, C., Galan, J.L., The resource-based theory: dissemination and main trends (2006) Strategic Management Journal, 27, pp. 621-636; Adner, R., Helfat, C.E., Corporate effects and dynamic managerial capabilities (2003) Strategic Management Journal, 24, pp. 1011-1025; Ahuja, G., Katila, R., Where do resources come from?

Sodium borohydride, NaBH4, seems to be a promising fuel in the context of the future hydrogen economy. NaBH4 belongs to a class of materials with the highest gravimetric hydrogen densities, which has been discovered in the 1940s by Schlesinger and Brown. In the present paper, the most relevant issues concerning the use of NaBH4 are examined. Its basic properties are summarised and its synthesis methods are described. The general processes of NaBH4 oxidation, hydrolysis, and monitoring are reviewed. A comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the NaBH 4 publications in the energy field opens the discussion for current perspectives and future outlook of NaBH4 as an efficient energy/hydrogen carrier. Despite the observed exponential increase in the research on NaBH4 it is clear that further efforts are still necessary for achieving significant overchanges. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

There are three types of bibliometric indicators: quantity indicators, which measure the productivity of a particular researcher; quality indicators, which measure the quality (or ""performance"") of a researcher's output; and structural indicators, which measure connections between publications, authors, and areas of research. Bibliometric indicators are especially important for researchers and organizations, as these measurements are often used in funding decisions, appointments, and promotions of researchers. As more and more scientific discoveries occur and published research results are read and then quoted by other researchers, bibliometric indicators are becoming increasingly important. This article provides an overview of the currently used bibliometric indicators and summarizes the critical elements and characteristics one should be aware of when evaluating the quantity and quality of scientific output. © RSNA, 2010.",,bibliometrics; medical literature; medical research; priority journal; publication; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; review; article; human; Internet; journal impact factor; medical research; publishing; quality control; standard; Bibliometrics; Biomedical Research; Humans; Internet; Journal Impact Factor; Publishing; Quality Control,"Whitehouse, G.H., Citation rates and impact factors: Should they matter?

Our objectives were to examine completeness of registration within ClinicalTrials.gov and to determine the extent and correlates of selective publication. Methods and Findings: We examined reporting of registration information among a cross-section of trials that had been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov after December 31, 1999 and updated as having been completed by June 8, 2007, excluding phase I trials. We then determined publication status among a random 10% subsample by searching MEDLINE using a systematic protocol, after excluding trials completed after December 31, 2005 to allow at least 2 y for publication following completion. Among the full sample of completed trials (n=7,515), nearly 100% reported all data elements mandated by ClinicalTrials.gov, such as intervention and sponsorship. Optional data element reporting varied, with 53% reporting trial end date, 66% reporting primary outcome, and 87% reporting trial start date. Among the 10% subsample, less than half (311 of 677, 46%) of trials were published, among which 96 (31%) provided a citation within ClinicalTrials.gov of a publication describing trial results. Trials primarily sponsored by industry (40%, 144 of 357) were less likely to be published when compared with nonindustry/nongovernment sponsored trials (56%, 110 of 198; p<0.001), but there was no significant difference when compared with government sponsored trials (47%, 57 of 122; p = 0.22). Among trials that reported an end date, 75 of 123 (61%) completed prior to 2004, 50 of 96 (52%) completed during 2004, and 62 of 149 (42%) completed during 2005 were published (p = 0.006). Conclusions: Reporting of optional data elements varied and publication rates among completed trials registered within ClinicalTrials.gov were low. Without greater attention to reporting of all data elements, the potential for ClinicalTrials.gov to address selective publication of clinical trials will be limited.",,"article; clinical research; funding; information retrieval; MEDLINE; outcome assessment; publication; registration; bibliometrics; clinical trial; cross-sectional study; drug industry; economics; factual database; financial management; human; information dissemination; Internet; library; publication; publishing; register; treatment outcome; United States; Bibliometrics; Clinical Trials as Topic; Cross-Sectional Studies; Databases, Factual; Drug Industry; Financing, Government; Humans; Information Dissemination; Internet; National Library of Medicine (U.S.); Periodicals as Topic; Publishing; Registries; Treatment Outcome; United States","Lee, K., Bacchetti, P., Sim, I., Publication of clinical trials supporting successful new drug applications: A literature analysis (2008) PLoS Med, 5, pp. e191. , doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0050191; Rising, K., Bacchetti, P., Bero, L.A., Reporting bias in drug trials submitted to the Food and Drug Administration: Review of publication and presentation (2008) PLoS Med, 5, pp. e217. , doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0050217; Nissen, S.E., Wolski, K., Effect of rosiglitazone on the risk of myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular causes (2007) New England Journal of Medicine, 356 (24), pp. 2457-2471. , http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/356/24/2457.pdf; Bennett, C.L., Silver, S.M., Djulbegovic, B., Samaras, A.T., Blau, C.A., Venous thromboembolism and mortality associated with recombinant erythropoietin and darbepoetin administration for the treatment of cancer-associated anemia (2008) JAMA, 299, pp. 914-924; Turner, E.H., Matthews, A.M., Linardatos, E., Tell, R.A., Rosenthal, R., Selective publication of antidepressant trials and its influence on apparent efficacy (2008) N Engl J Med, 358, pp. 252-260; DeAngelis, C.D., Drazen, J.M., Frizelle, F.A., Haug, C., Hoey, J., Clinical trial registration: A statement from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (2004) JAMA, 292, pp. 1363-1364; Zarin, D.A., Tse, T., Ide, N.C., Trial registration at ClinicalTrials.gov between May and October 2005 (2005) New England Journal of Medicine, 353 (26), pp. 2779-2787. , http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/353/26/2779.pdf, DOI 10.1056/NEJMsa053234; (2009) About ClinicalTrials.gov, , http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/info/about, U.

Much less attention has been paid to the construction of these networks. We point out that different approaches can be taken to construct a bibliometric network. Normally the full counting approach is used, but we propose an alternative fractional counting approach. The basic idea of the fractional counting approach is that each action, such as co-authoring or citing a publication, should have equal weight, regardless of for instance the number of authors, citations, or references of a publication. We present two empirical analyses in which the full and fractional counting approaches yield very different results. These analyses deal with co-authorship networks of universities and bibliographic coupling networks of journals. Based on theoretical considerations and on the empirical analyses, we conclude that for many purposes the fractional counting approach is preferable over the full counting one. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Bibliographic coupling network; Bibliometric network; Co-authorship network; Co-citation network; Fractional counting; Full counting,Computer applications; Bibliographic couplings; Bibliometric; Co-authorship networks; Co-citation networks; Fractional counting; Full counting; Bibliographies,"Ahlgren, P., Jarneving, B., Rousseau, R., Requirements for a cocitation similarity measure, with special reference to Pearson's correlation coefficient (2003) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 54 (6), pp. 550-560; Aksnes, D.W., Schneider, J.W., Gunnarsson, M., Ranking national research systems by citation indicators.

Previous studies have found that papers with publicly available datasets receive a higher number of citations than similar studies without available data. However, few previous analyses have had the statistical power to control for the many variables known to predict citation rate, which has led to uncertain estimates of the ""citation benefit"". Furthermore, little is known about patterns in data reuse over time and across datasets. Method and Results: Here, we look at citation rates while controlling for many known citation predictors and investigate the variability of data reuse. In a multivariate regression on 10,555 studies that created gene expression microarray data, we found that studies that made data available in a public repository received 9% (95% confidence interval: 5% to 13%) more citations than similar studies for which the data was not made available. Date of publication, journal impact factor, open access status, number of authors, first and last author publication history, corresponding author country, institution citation history, and study topic were included as covariates. The citation benefit varied with date of dataset deposition: a citation benefit was most clear for papers published in 2004 and 2005, at about 30%. Authors published most papers using their own datasets within two years of their first publication on the dataset, whereas data reuse papers published by third-party investigators continued to accumulate for at least six years. To study patterns of data reuse directly, we compiled 9,724 instances of third party data reuse via mention of GEO or ArrayExpress accession numbers in the full text of papers. The level of third-party data use was high: for 100 datasets deposited in year 0, we estimated that 40 papers in PubMed reused a dataset by year 2, 100 by year 4, and more than 150 data reuse papers had been published by year 5. Data reuse was distributed across a broad base of datasets: a very conservative estimate found that 20% of the datasets deposited between 2003 and 2007 had been reused at least once by third parties. Conclusion: After accounting for other factors affecting citation rate, we find a robust citation benefit from open data, although a smaller one than previously reported. We conclude there is a direct effect of third-party data reuse that persists for years beyond the time when researchers have published most of the papers reusing their own data. Other factors that may also contribute to the citation benefit are considered. We further conclude that, at least for gene expression microarray data, a substantial fraction of archived datasets are reused, and that the intensity of dataset reuse has been steadily increasing since 2003. © Copyright 2013 Piwowar and Vision.",Bibliometrics; Data archiving; Data repositories; Data reuse; Gene expression microarray; Incentives; Information science; Open data,article; bibliometrics; bioinformatics; citation analysis; clinical data repository; data analysis; data base; gene expression; literature; microarray analysis; multivariate logistic regression analysis; neoplasm; publication; scientist; statistical analysis; stratified sample,"Boettiger, C., (2013) knitcitations: citations for knitr markdown files, , https://github.com/cboettig/knitcitations; Craig, I.D., Plum, A.M., McVeigh, M.E., Pringle, J., Amin, M., Do open access articles have greater citation impact?: A critical review of the literature (2007) Journal of Informetrics, 1 (3), pp. 239-248. , DOI 10.1016/j.joi.2007.04.001; Dorch, B., (2012) On the Citation Advantage of linking to data. hprints, , http://hprints.org/hprints-00714715, Available at, accessed 5 July 2012; Fox, J., (2010) polycor: polychoric and polyserial correlations, , http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=polycor; Fu, L.D., Aliferis, C., (2008) Models for predicting and explaining citation count of biomedical articles, , http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2656101&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract, AMIA Symposium 222-226; Gleditsch, N.P., Metelits, C., Strand, H., Posting your data: will you be scooped or will you be famous?

The worrying aspect associated with this trend is the significant decline in citation impact Australia is achieving relative to other countries. It has dropped from sixth position in a ranking of 11 OECD countries in 1988, to 10th position by 1993, and the distance from ninth place continues to widen. The increased publication activity came at a time when publication output was expected to decline due to pressures facing the higher education sector, which accounts for over two-thirds of Australian publications. This paper examines possible methodological and contextual explanations of the trends in Australia's presence in the SCI, and undertakes a detailed comparison of two universities that introduced diverse research management strategies in the late 1980s. The conclusion reached is that the driving force behind the Australian trends appears to lie with the increased culture of evaluation faced by the sector. Significant funds are distributed to universities, and within universities, on the basis of aggregate publication counts, with little attention paid to the impact or quality of that output. In consequence, journal publication productivity has increased significantly in the last decade, but its impact has declined. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This review presents critically the analytical techniques which are used for authenticity assessment, explaining how and why they give plausible solutions. Classification of different methodologies is based on authenticity indicators providing insight into future developments. Analytical breakthroughs and novel techniques that emerged recently are discussed, along with their applications on food authentication. We have discussed current limits and gaps, related to informatics needs for data analysis of large quantities. Reporting standards and reference database are elaborated indicating urgent needs for the progress of this field. A scientometric evaluation highlighted the research trends and emerging approaches of this evolving field. Popular analytical techniques are commented, while the potential of the field is depicted in the temporal evolution of the research output focusing on geographical distribution of research activity and preferred journals used for dissemination. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Adulteration; Analytical techniques; Authenticity; Botanical origin; Food authentication; Fraud; Geographical origin; Scientometric evaluation; Species,Authentication; Geographical distribution; Adulteration; Analytical techniques; Authenticity; Botanical origin; Food authentications; Fraud; Geographical origins; Scientometrics; Species; Food safety; calcium; carbon; carbon 13; cerium; copper; deuterium; hydrogen 1; iridium; isotope; lanthanum; lead; lead 204; lead 206; lead 207; neodymium 43; neodymium 44; nitrogen; nitrogen 15; oxygen; oxygen 18; potassium; samarium; selenium; sodium; strontium 86; strontium 87; sulfur; sulfur 34; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; zinc; analytic method; atomic emission spectrometry; bioinformatics; chemometrics; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry; DNA fingerprinting; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fluorescence spectroscopy; food authentication; food processing; gas chromatography; isotope ratio mass spectrometry; liquid chromatography; mass fragmentography; mass spectrometry; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; multi collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; peptide nnucleic acid; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry; random amplified polymorphic DNA; Review; sensory analysis; single strand conformation polymorphism; site specific natural isotopic fractionation nuclear magnetic resonance; thermal ionization mass spectrometry; time of flight mass spectrometry; vibrational spectroscopy,"Aung, M.M., Chang, Y.S., Traceability in a food supply chain: safety and quality perspectives (2014) Food Control, 39, pp. 172-184; Drivelos, S.A., Georgiou, C.A., Multi-element and multi-isotope-ratio analysis to determine the geographical origin of foods in the European Union (2012) Trends Anal.

This present situation inhibits the integration of findings. This paper traces the content, scope and relatively short history of modern social innovation research across disciplines by applying network and bibliometric analyses, and explores their relevance to innovation studies. Based on data from 172 publications, we analyze scholarly works that directly address the social innovation topic, allowing us to identify the precedence, dynamics and the current map of social innovation research as an emerging field of study. Our analysis suggests that the SI field is grounded in four distinct intellectual communities arising through a somewhat organized diffusion process: 1) Community Psychology; 2) Creativity research; 3) Social and societal challenges; 4) Local development. The interest of SI in the areas of management and entrepreneurship is only very recent and is currently reflected within existing communities. We forge conceptual bridges between the two (currently very separate) domains of social innovation and innovation studies, and the implications of our finding for further research and policy are also discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Bibliometrics; Integrative literature review; Social entrepreneurship; Social innovation; Social technology; Social value,Engineering; Bibliometrics; Literature reviews; Social entrepreneurship; Social innovations; Social technologies; Social values; Innovation,"Adams, D., Hess, M., Social innovation and why it has policy significance (2010) Econ.

Design: Cross sectional survey using a web based questionnaire. Setting: International survey of journal authors. Participants: Sample of corresponding authors of 896 research articles, review articles, and editorial/opinion articles published in six general medical journals with high impact factors in 2008: Annals of Internal Medicine, JAMA, Lancet, Nature Medicine, New England Journal of Medicine, and PLoS Medicine. Main outcome measures: Self reported compliance with International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) criteria for authorship for all authors on the selected articles. Results: A total of 630/896 (70.3%) corresponding authors responded to the survey. The prevalence of articles with honorary authorship or ghost authorship, or both, was 21.0% (95% CI 18.0% to 24.3%), a decrease from 29.2% reported in 1996 (P=0.004). Based on 545 responses on honorary authorship, 96 articles (17.6% (95% CI 14.6% to 21.0%)) had honorary authors (range by journal 12.2% to 29.3%), a non-significant change from 1996 (19.3%; P=0.439). Based on 622 responses on ghost authorship, 49 articles (7.9% (6.0% to 10.3%)) had ghost authors (range by journal 2.1% to 11.0%), a significant decline from 1996 (11.5%; P=0.023). The prevalence of honorary authorship was 25.0% in original research reports, 15.0% in reviews, and 11.2% in editorials, whereas the prevalence of ghost authorship was 11.9% in research articles, 6.0% in reviews, and 5.3% in editorials. Conclusions: Evidence of honorary and ghost authorship in 21% of articles published in major medical journals in 2008 suggests that increased efforts by scientific journals, individual authors, and academic institutions are essential to promote responsibility, accountability, and transparency in authorship, and to maintain integrity in scientific publication.",,article; author; biomedicine; editorial; ghost author; medical literature; medical research; priority journal; publication; questionnaire; writing; bibliometrics; cross-sectional study; human; practice guideline; publication; publishing; statistics; Authorship; Bibliometrics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Editorial Policies; Guidelines as Topic; Humans; Periodicals as Topic; Publishing; Questionnaires,"Place, F., Ghost writing (1934) Bull Med Libr Assoc, 22, pp. 209-213; DeBakey, L., Rewriting and the by-line: Is the author the writer?

We examine the strong link between bibliometrics and the Thomson Scientific's database and review the differences in the production and diffusion of knowledge in the social sciences and humanities (SSH) and the natural sciences and engineering (NSE). This leads to a re-examination of the debate on the coverage of these databases, more specifically in the SSH. The methods section explains how we have compared the coverage of Thomson Scientific databases in the NSE and SSH to the Ulrich extensive database of journals. Our results show that there is a 20 to 25% overrepresentation of English-language journals in Thomson Scientific's databases compared to the list of journals presented in Ulrich. This paper concludes that because of this bias, Thomson Scientific databases cannot be used in isolation to benchmark the output of countries in the SSH.

The mathematics of PageRank, however, are entirely general and apply to any graph or network in any domain. Thus, PageRank is now regularly used in bibliometrics, social and information network analysis, and for link prediction and recommendation. It's even used for systems analysis of road networks, as well as biology, chemistry, neuroscience, and physics.

We begin by documenting the relative insularity of economics, using bibliometric data. Next we analyze the tight management of the field from the top down, which gives economics its characteristic hierarchical structure. Economists also distinguish themselves from other social scientists through their much better material situation (many teach in business schools, have external consulting activities), their more individualist worldviews, and their confidence in their discipline's ability to fix the world's problems. Taken together, these traits constitute what we call the superiority of economists, where economists' objective supremacy is intimately linked with their subjective sense of authority and entitlement. While this superiority has certainly fueled economists' practical involvement and their considerable influence over the economy, it has also exposed them more to conflicts of interests, political critique, even derision. © 2015, American Economic Association.

We distinguish two different methods. In the first application, research performance assessment, the bibliometric method is based on advanced analysis of publication and citation data. We show that the resulting indicators are very useful, and in fact an indispensable element next to peer review in research evaluation procedures. Indicators based on advanced bibliometric methods offer much more than 'only numbers'. They provide insight into the position of actors at the research front in terms of influence and specializations, as well as into patterns of scientific communication and processes of knowledge dissemination. After a discussion of technical and methodological problems, we present practical examples of the use of research performance indicators. In the second application, monitoring scientific developments, bibliometric methods based on advanced mapping techniques are essential. We discuss these techniques briefly and indicate their most important potentials, particularly their role in foresight exercises. Finally, we give a first outline of how both bibliometric approaches can be combined to a broader and powerful methodology to observe scientific advancement and the role of actors.",,,"Cole, S., Rubin, L., Cole, J.R., (1978) Peer Review in the National Science Foundation, , Washington DC: National Academy of Sciences, (ISBN: 0-309-02788-8); (1990) Peer Review: A Report to the Advisory Board for the Research Councils from the Working Group on Peer Review ('Boden Report'), , London: Advisory Board for the Research Councils (ABRC); Daniel, H.-D., An evaluation of the peer review process at Angewandte Chemie (1993) Angew.

This helps identify fertile research streams with great potential for further examination. This paper presents a systematic review of the quantitative and analytical models (i.e. mathematical, optimization and simulation modeling efforts) for managing supply chain risks. We use bibliometric and network analysis tools to generate insights that have not been captured in the previous reviews on the topic. In particular, we complete a systemic mapping of the literature that identifies the key research clusters/topics, interrelationships, and generative research areas that have provided the field with the foundational knowledge, concepts, theories, tools, and techniques. Some of our findings include (1) quantitative analysis of supply chain risk is expanding rapidly; (2) European journals are the more popular research outlets for the dissemination of the knowledge developed by researchers in United States and Asia; and (3) sustainability risk analysis is an emerging and fast evolving research topic. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) withinthe International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).

Alternative metrics (called altmetrics to distinguish them from bibliometrics) are considered an interesting option for assessing the societal impact of research, as they offer new ways to measure (public) engagement with research output. Altmetrics is a term to describe web-based metrics for the impact of publications and other scholarly material by using data from social media platforms (e.g. Twitter or Mendeley). This overview of studies explores the potential of altmetrics for measuring societal impact. It deals with the definition and classification of altmetrics. Furthermore, their benefits and disadvantages for measuring impact are discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Altmetrics; Broader impact; Scientometrics; Societal impact,Social networking (online); Altmetrics; Bibliometrics; Broader impacts; Peer review; Research outputs; Scientometrics; Social media platforms; Societal impacts; Economic and social effects,"Adie, E., The grey literature from an altmetrics perspective - opportunity and challenges (2014) Research Trends, (37), pp. 23-25; Adie, E., Roe, W., Altmetric: Enriching scholarly content with article-level discussion and metrics (2013) Learned Publishing, 26 (1), pp. 11-17; (2010) Publication manual of the American Psychological Association, , American Psychological Association (APA), Washington, DC, USA; Bar-Ilan, J., Shema, H., Thelwall, M., Bibliographic references in: Web 2.0 (2014) Beyond bibliometrics: Harnessing multi-dimensional indicators of performance, pp. 307-325. , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, USA, B.

Nowhere is this more relevant than in the case of nanotechnology (hereafter identified as ""nano"") given its current rapid growth and multidisciplinary nature. (Under the rubric of nanotechnology, we also include nanoscience and nanoengineering.) Past efforts have utilized several strategies, including simple term search for the prefix nano, complex lexical and citation-based approaches, and bootstrapping techniques. This research introduces a modularized Boolean approach to defining nanotechnology which has been applied to several research and patenting databases. We explain our approach to downloading and cleaning data, and report initial results. Comparisons of this approach with other nanotechnology search formulations are presented. Implications for search strategy development and profiling of the nanotechnology field are discussed. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Bibliometric analysis; Nanoinformatics; Nanopatenting; Nanoscience and engineering; Nanotechnology publication; Research profiling; Search strategies,Bibliographic retrieval systems; Boolean functions; Database systems; Engineering research; Patents and inventions; Bibliometric analysis; Nanoinformatics; Nanopatenting; Nanoscience and engineering; Nanotechnology publication; Research profiling; Search strategies; Nanotechnology; nanomaterial; algorithm; commercial phenomena; data base; information science; microscopy; molecular electronics; nanobiotechnology; nanochemistry; nanoengineering; nanotechnology; online system; patent; priority journal; quantum theory; research; review,"Alencar, M.S.M., Porter, A.L., Antunes, A.M.S., Nanopatenting patterns in relation to product life cycle (2007) Technol Forecast Soc Change, , forthcoming; Bassecoulard, E., Lelu, A., Zitt, M., Mapping nanosciences by citation flows: A preliminary analysis (2007) Scientometrics, 70, pp. 859-880. , 3; Drexler, E., Peterson, C., (1991) Unbounding the Future: The Nanotechnology Revolution, , William Morrow and Company New York; Group, E.T.C., (2003) From Genomes to Atoms: The Big Down, , The etc Group Winnipeg, Canada; (2002) Search Methodology for Mapping Nanotechnology Patents, , Fraunhofer Institute for Systems, Innovations Research.

This technology has found a rapidly growing market, with global sales expected to top US $7 billion by 2008. An increasing variety of enterprises are employing RFID to improve their efficiency of operations and to gain a competitive advantage. To shed light on RFID trends, and contributions, a historical review and bibliometric analysis are included in this research. The bibliometric analytical technique was used to examine this topic in SCI journals from 1991 through November of 2005. Also, a historical review method was used to analyze RFID innovation, adoption by organizations, and market diffusion. From the analysis of the study's findings, supply chain management (SCM), health industry, and privacy issues emerge as the major trends in RFID. Also, the contributions of the RFID industry and forecasts of technological trends were also analyzed, concluding that RFID will be more ubiquitously diffused and assimilated into our daily lives in the near future. © 2006.",Bibliometric;

Although bibliometric analysis can be applied to any type of publication the main focus is on journals. Five approaches to the evaluation of journal quality are identified: stated preference, citation-based, derived, hybrid, and expert panels. Different productivity, impact and hybrid metrics are used to identify rankings of tourism journals from Scopus/SCImago data, compared with a derived RAE ranking, and three expert panel rankings. The different rankings reinforces that bibliometric understanding of scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct. However, bibliometric analysis does not occur in an institutional and policy vacuum. The institutional context of government and private organization evaluations of research quality increasingly determine which metrics are applied, with subsequent effects on performance evaluation, career development and future direction of tourism studies. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Economization; Institutional context; Journal impact; Journal prestige; Journal ranking; Neoliberalism; SCImago; Scopus,database; neoliberalism; performance assessment; qualitative analysis; ranking; tourism management; Scopus,"Adler, N.J., Harzing, A., When knowledge wins: transcending the sense and nonsense of academic rankings (2009) The Academy of Management Learning and Education, 8, pp. 72-95; Adler, R., Ewing, J., Taylor, P., (2008) Citation statistics.

The indicator aims to normalize citation counts for differences among fields. We critically examine the theoretical basis of the normalization mechanism applied in the crown indicator. We also make a comparison with an alternative normalization mechanism. The alternative mechanism turns out to have more satisfactory properties than the mechanism applied in the crown indicator. In particular, the alternative mechanism has a so-called consistency property. The mechanism applied in the crown indicator lacks this important property. As a consequence of our findings, we are currently moving towards a new crown indicator, which relies on the alternative normalization mechanism. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Bibliometric indicator; Consistency; Crown indicator; Normalization,,"Aksnes, D.W., Sivertsen, G., A macro-study of scientific productivity and publication patterns across all scientific and scholarly disciplines (2009) Proceedings of the 12th international conference on scientometrics and informetrics, pp. 394-398. , B.

More specifically, we analyze the way the media present the question of who is responsible for causing and fixing the problem. Our data reveal that over the last 10 years, mentions of personal causes and solutions significantly have outnumbered societal attributions of responsibility. Recently, however, a balance was established between individualistic and societal attributions of responsibility. Mentions of societal causes and solutions have increased considerably, whereas decreasing numbers of personal solutions have appeared in the media. Findings also indicate that television news is more likely than newspapers to mention personal solutions, but less likely to attribute the responsibility to society.

Over the last ten years we have devoted much of our energy to the development of an analogous research base and infrastructure for patent bibliometrics, that is for the use of patents, and patent citations in the evaluation of technological activities. There are remarkable similarities between literature bibliometrics and patent bibliometrics, and they are both applicable to the same wide ranges of problems. This paper will show that there are striking similarities between literature and patent distributions of national productivity, inventor productivity, referencing cycles, citation impact and within country citation preferences. © 1994 Akadémiai Kiadó.",,,"Cole, F.J., Eales, N.B., The history of comparative anatomy (1917) Science Progress, 11, pp. 578-596; D.

Despite the progress made in the study of sustainability, there is a paucity of research on the topic in premier marketing journals. To address this issue, we focus on marketing-related journals and assess the intellectual structure of sustainability research in detail. Drawing on social network theory, we perform an extensive co-citation analysis using multidimensional scaling to examine 76,342 citations made in 1,320 sustainability-focused articles from 36 journals over 51 years (1958-2008). This study specifies that the topics of citizenship behavior, stakeholder theory, corporate performance, and the triple bottom line are integral sustainability research areas. In addition, the results indicate five required topics for examining sustainability in the marketing context: external-internal focus, social-environmental emphasis, legal-ethical-discretionary intent, marketing assets, and financial performance. Supported by the capabilities-based resource perspective, the sustainability-focused typology and framework advanced provide directed structure for future research. © 2010 Academy of Marketing Science.",Bibliometric analysis; Corporate environmental performance; Corporate environmental responsibility; Corporate responsibility; Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; Intellectual structure; Longitudinal analysis; Marketing-finance interface; Multidimensional scaling; Social network theory; Sustainability; Triple bottom line,,"Abela, A.V., Murphy, P.E., Marketing with integrity: ethics and the service-dominant logic for marketing (2008) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 36 (1), pp. 39-53; Aguilera, R.V., Rupp, D.E., Williams, C.A., Ganapathi, J., Putting the S back in corporate social responsibility: a multilevel theory of social change in organizations (2007) Academy of Management Review, 32 (3), pp. 836-863; Alba, R.D., Moore, G., Elite social circles (1983) Applied Network Analysis, pp. 245-261. , R.

Although effective and simple, the h-index suffers from some drawbacks that limit its use in accurately and fairly comparing the scientific output of different researchers. These drawbacks include information loss and low resolution: the former refers to the fact that in addition to h2 citations for papers in the h-core, excess citations are completely ignored, whereas the latter means that it is common for a group of researchers to have an identical h-index.Methodology/Principal Findings:To solve these problems, I here propose the e-index, where e2 represents the ignored excess citations, in addition to the h2 citations for h-core papers. Citation information can be completely depicted by using the h-index together with the e-index, which are independent of each other. Some other h-type indices, such as a and R, are h-dependent, have information redundancy with h, and therefore, when used together with h, mask the real differences in excess citations of different researchers.Conclusions/Significance:Although simple, the e-index is a necessary h-index complement, especially for evaluating highly cited scientists or for precisely comparing the scientific output of a group of scientists having an identical h-index. © 2009 Zhang.",,article; bibliometrics; documentation; personnel; publication; Abstracting and Indexing as Topic; Bibliometrics; Biobibliography as Topic; Research Personnel,"Hirsch, J.E., An index to quantify an individual's scientific research output (2005) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 102, pp. 16569-16572; Hirsch, J.E., Does the h index have predictive power?

Box 2815 Tøyen, Oslo, NO-0608, Norway","The notion of the bioeconomy has gained importance in both research and policy debates over the last decade, and is frequently argued to be a key part of the solution to multiple grand challenges. Despite this, there seems to be little consensus concerning what bioeconomy actually implies. Consequently, this paper seeks to enhance our understanding of what the notion of bioeconomy means by exploring the origins, uptake, and contents of the term ""bioeconomy"" in the academic literature. Firstly, we perform a bibliometric analysis that highlights that the bioeconomy research community is still rather fragmented and distributed across many different fields of science, even if natural and engineering sciences take up the most central role. Secondly, we carry out a literature review that identifies three visions of the bioeconomy. The bio-technology vision emphasises the importance of bio-technology research and application and commercialisation of bio-technology in different sectors of the economy. The bio-resource vision focuses on processing and upgrading of biological raw materials, as well as on the establishment of new value chains. Finally, the bio-ecology vision highlights sustainability and ecological processes that optimise the use of energy and nutrients, promote biodiversity, and avoid monocultures and soil degradation. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Bibliometric analysis; Bioeconomy; Biotechnology; Grand challenges; Review; Sustainability,bibliography; biotechnology; commercialization; economic activity; literature review; research and development; statistical analysis; sustainability,"Europe Must Focus on the Grand Challenges of Our Time (2009), Swedish EU Presidency: Lund, Sweden; Coenen, L., Hansen, T., Rekers, J.V., Innovation policy for grand challenges (2015) An economic geography perspective.

At the beginning of the 21st century we witness considerable growth in webometrics, mapping and visualization and open access. A new topic is comparison between citation databases, as a result of the introduction of two new citation databases Scopus and Google Scholar. There is renewed interest in indicators as a result of the introduction of the h-index. Traditional topics like citation analysis and informetric theory also continue to develop. The impact factor debate, especially outside the informetric literature continues to thrive. Ranked lists (of journal, highly cited papers or of educational institutions) are of great public interest. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of the study was to perform a bibliometric analysis of all tsunami-related publications in the Science Citation Index (SCI). Analyzed parameters included document type, language of publication, publication output, authorship, publication patterns, distribution of subject category, distribution of author keywords, country of publication, most-frequently cited article, and document distribution after the Indonesia tsunami. The US and Japan produced 53% of the total output where the seven major industrial countries accounted for the majority of the total production. English was the dominant language, comprising 95% of articles. A simulation model was applied to describe the relationship between the number of authors and the number of articles, the number of journals and the number of articles, and the percentage of total articles and the number of times a certain keyword was used. Moreover the tsunami publication patterns in the first 8 months after the Indonesia tsunami occurred on 26 December 2004 indicated a high percentage of non-article publications and more documents being published in journals with higher impact factors. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,,"Adler, M.D., Johnson, K.B., Quantifying the literature of computer-aided instruction in medical education (2000) Academic Medicine, 75, pp. 1025-1028. , 10; Brambrink, A.M., Ehrler, D., Dick, W.F., Publications on paediatric anaesthesia: A quantitative analysis of publication activity and international recognition (2000) British Journal of Anaesthesia, 85, pp. 556-562. , 4; Chiu, W.T., Ho, Y.S., Bibliometric analysis of homeopathy research during the period of 1991 to 2003 (2005) Scientometrics, 63, pp. 3-23. , 1; Garfield, E., Welljamsdorof, A., The microbiology literature: Languages of publication and their relative citation impact (1992) FEMS Microbiology Letters, 100, pp. 33-37. , 1-3; Hsieh, W.H., Chiu, W.T., Lee, Y.S., Ho, Y.S., Bibliometric analysis of patent ductus arteriosus treatments (2004) Scientometrics, 60, pp. 205-215. , 2; Lander, J.F., Whiteside, L.S., Lockridge, P.A., Two decades of global tsunamis - 1982-2002 (2002) Science of Tsunami Hazards, 21, pp. 3-88. , 3; Lindley, D., Swinbanks, D., Satellite-linked tsunami warning to avoid Pacific disasters (1987) Nature, 330, p. 305. , 6146; National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) Tsunami Database, , http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/hazard/tsu.shtml, Accessed 8 August 2005; (2005) Designing for Tsunamis: Seven Principles for Planning and Designing for Tsunami Hazards, March 2001, , http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tsunami-hazard/Designing_for_Tsunamis.pdf, National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program.

Despite several assessments, the current knowledge on NETs is still diffuse and incomplete, but also growing fast. Here, we synthesize a comprehensive body of NETs literature, using scientometric tools and performing an in-depth assessment of the quantitative and qualitative evidence therein. We clarify the role of NETs in climate change mitigation scenarios, their ethical implications, as well as the challenges involved in bringing the various NETs to the market and scaling them up in time. There are six major findings arising from our assessment: first, keeping warming below 1.5 °C requires the large-scale deployment of NETs, but this dependency can still be kept to a minimum for the 2 °C warming limit. Second, accounting for economic and biophysical limits, we identify relevant potentials for all NETs except ocean fertilization. Third, any single NET is unlikely to sustainably achieve the large NETs deployment observed in many 1.5 °C and 2 °C mitigation scenarios. Yet, portfolios of multiple NETs, each deployed at modest scales, could be invaluable for reaching the climate goals. Fourth, a substantial gap exists between the upscaling and rapid diffusion of NETs implied in scenarios and progress in actual innovation and deployment. If NETs are required at the scales currently discussed, the resulting urgency of implementation is currently neither reflected in science nor policy. Fifth, NETs face severe barriers to implementation and are only weakly incentivized so far. Finally, we identify distinct ethical discourses relevant for NETs, but highlight the need to root them firmly in the available evidence in order to render such discussions relevant in practice. © 2018 The Author(s).

Design: Cross sectional analysis. Setting: Clinical trials funded by NIH and registered within ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov), a trial registry and results database maintained by the US National Library of Medicine, after 30 September 2005 and updated as having been completed by 31 December 2008, allowing at least 30 months for publication after completion of the trial. Main outcome measures: Publication and time to publication in the biomedical literature, as determined through Medline searches, the last of which was performed in June 2011. Results: Among 635 clinical trials completed by 31 December 2008, 294 (46%) were published in a peer reviewed biomedical journal, indexed by Medline, within 30 months of trial completion. The median period of follow-up after trial completion was 51 months (25th-75th centiles 40-68 months), and 432 (68%) were published overall. Among published trials, the median time to publication was 23 months (14-36 months). Trials completed in either 2007 or 2008 were more likely to be published within 30 months of study completion compared with trials completed before 2007 (54% (196/366) v 36% (98/269); P<0.001). Conclusions Despite recent improvement in timely publication, fewer than half of trials funded by NIH are published in a peer reviewed biomedical journal indexed by Medline within 30 months of trial completion. Moreover, after a median of 51 months after trial completion, a third of trials remained unpublished.",,"cross-sectional study; data base; follow up; funding; human; information processing; medical information; medical literature; national health organization; peer review; priority journal; publication; publishing; review; United States; Bibliometrics; Clinical Trials as Topic; Cross-Sectional Studies; Databases, Factual; MEDLINE; National Institutes of Health (U.S.); National Library of Medicine (U.S.); Peer Review, Research; Periodicals as Topic; Publishing; Registries; Research Support as Topic; United States","Chan, A.-W., Hrobjartsson, A., Haahr, M.T., Gotzsche, P.C., Altman, D.G., Empirical evidence for selective reporting of outcomes in randomized trials: Comparison of protocols to published articles (2004) Journal of the American Medical Association, 291 (20), pp. 2457-2465. , DOI 10.1001/jama.291.20.2457; Chan, A.-W., Krleza-Jeric, K., Schmid, I., Altman, D.G., Outcome reporting bias in randomized trials funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (2004) Canadian Medical Association Journal, 171 (7), pp. 735-740. , DOI 10.1503/cmaj.1041086; Decullier, E., Lheritier, V., Chapuis, F., Fate of biomedical research protocols and publication bias in France: Retrospective cohort study (2005) BMJ, 331, p. 19; Dickersin, K., Min, Y.I., NIH clinical trials and publication bias (1993) Online J Curr Clin Trials, , Apr 28:doc50; Dickersin, K., Min, Y.I., Meinert, C.L., Factors influencing publication of research results.

However, few studies have attempted to map the global research of sustainability. This study utilizes scientometric review of global trend and structure of sustainability research in 1991–2016 using techniques such as co-author, co-word, co-citation, clusters, and geospatial analyses. A total of 2094 bibliographic records from the Web of Science database were analyzed to generate the study's research power networks and geospatial map. The findings reveal an evolution of the research field from the definition of its concepts in the Brundtland Commission report to the recent development of models and sustainability indicators. The most significant contributions in sustainability research have originated primarily from the United States, China, United Kingdom and Canada. Also, existing studies in sustainability research focus mainly on subject categories of environmental sciences, green & sustainable science technology, civil engineering, and construction & building technology. Emerging trends in sustainability research were sustainable urban development, sustainability indicators, water management, environmental assessment, public policy, etc.; while the study generated 21 co-citation clusters. This study provides its readers with an extensive understanding of the salient research themes, trends and pattern of sustainability research worldwide. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Built environment; Research trends; Scientometric; Sustainability; Sustainable development,Bibliographic retrieval systems; Electric network analysis; Environmental protection; Environmental technology; Planning; Research and development management; Urban growth; Water management; Building technologies; Built environment; Environmental assessment; Environmental science; Research trends; Scientometrics; Sustainability indicators; Sustainable urban development; Sustainable development,"Aarseth, W., Ahola, T., Aaltonen, K., Økland, A., Andersen, B., Project sustainability strategies: a systematic literature review (2016) Int.

The concept of schizophrenia as a disease entity has been with us for a little more than a century, although descriptions resembling this condition predate this conceptualization. In 1988, for the inaugural issue of Schizophrenia Research, at the invitation of the founding editors, a senior researcher, since deceased (RJ Wyatt)11Richard J. Wyatt participated substantially in the initial phases of manuscript development. He passed away in 2002. published a summary of generally accepted ideas about the disorder, which he termed ""the facts"" of schizophrenia. Ten years later, in conjunction with two of the authors (MSK, RT), he compiled a more extensive set of ""facts"" for the purpose of evaluating conceptual models or theoretical constructs developed to understand the nature of schizophrenia. On the 20th anniversary of this journal, we update and substantially expand our effort to periodically summarize the current body of information about schizophrenia. We compile a body of seventy-seven representative major findings and group them in terms of their specific relevance to schizophrenia - etiologies, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and treatments. We rate each such ""fact"" on a 0-3 scale for measures of reproducibility, whether primary to schizophrenia, and durability over time. We also pose one or more critical questions with reference to each ""fact"", answers to which might help better elucidate the meaning of that finding for our understanding of schizophrenia. We intend to follow this paper with the submission to the journal of a series of topic-specific articles, critically reviewing the evidence. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The ranking includes 500 major universities from 41 different countries. This paper provides an extensive discussion of the Leiden Ranking 2011/2012. The ranking is compared with other global university rankings, in particular the Academic Ranking of World Universities (commonly known as the Shanghai Ranking) and the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. The comparison focuses on the methodological choices underlying the different rankings. Also, a detailed description is offered of the data collection methodology of the Leiden Ranking 2011/2012 and of the indicators used in the ranking. Various innovations in the Leiden Ranking 2011/2012 are presented. These innovations include (1) an indicator based on counting a university's highly cited publications, (2) indicators based on fractional rather than full counting of collaborative publications, (3) the possibility of excluding non-English language publications, and (4) the use of stability intervals. Finally, some comments are made on the interpretation of the ranking and a number of limitations of the ranking are pointed out. © 2012 ASIS&T.",bibliometrics; citation analysis,Bibliometric; Bibliometrics; Citation analysis; Citation impact; Data collection; Higher education; Non-English languages; Scientific collaboration; Stability interval; Data acquisition; Publishing; Societies and institutions; Education,"Aguillo, I.F., Bar-Ilan, J., Levene, M., Ortega, J.L., Comparing university rankings (2010) Scientometrics, 85 (1), pp. 243-256; Aguillo, I.F., Ortega, J.L., Fernández, M., Webometric Ranking of World Universities: Introduction, methodology, and future developments (2008) Higher Education in Europe, 33 (23), pp. 233-244; Aksnes, D.W., Schneider, J.W., Gunnarsson, M., Ranking national research systems by citation indicators.

Each edition attempts to forecast the most promising technologies likely to impact on education along three horizons: the short term (the year of the report), the mid-term (the next 2 years) and the long term (the next 4 years). This paper analyzes the evolution of technology trends from 2004 to 2014 that correspond to the long-term predictions of the most recent Horizon Report. The study analyzes through bibliometric analysis which technologies were successful and became a regular part of education systems, which ones failed to have the predicted impact and why, and the shape of technology flows in recent years. The study also shows how the evolution and maturity of some technologies allowed the revival of expectations for others. The analysis here, which focuses on educational applications, offers guidelines that may be helpful to those seeking to invest in new research areas. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This essay starts by providing a brief overview of social commerce research and practice in light of the wide attention it has drawn in the industry. Then, we propose a research framework with an integrated view of social commerce that consists of four key components: business, technology, people, and information. The framework helps us understand the development of social commerce research and practice to date. Subsequently, we report some preliminary findings from a bibliometric study of academic and industry publications in social commerce to reveal recent trends and research topics, as well as some verification of the research framework. Finally, we discuss five articles in this special issue and categorize them in terms of the proposed social commerce research framework. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presented an overview on the researches about anaerobic digestion of food waste. Technologies (e.g., pretreatment, co-digestion, inhibition and mitigation, anaerobic digestion systems, etc.) were introduced and evaluated on the basis of bibliometric analysis. Results indicated that ethanol and aerobic prefermentation were novel approaches to enhance substrates hydrolysis and methane yield. With the promotion of resource recovery, more attention should be paid to biorefinery technologies which can produce more useful products toward zero emissions. Furthermore, a technological route for food waste conversion based on anaerobic digestion was proposed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Bibliometric analysis; Biorefinery; Methane; Two-stage anaerobic system; Waste bioconversion,Bioconversion; Industrial waste disposal; Industrial waste treatment; Methane; Refining; Anaerobic systems; Bibliometric analysis; Biorefineries; Methane Yield; Pre-Treatment; Prefermentation; Resource recovery; Technological route; Anaerobic digestion; alcohol; methane; anaerobic digestion; biological method; fermentation; food waste; methane; quantitative analysis; recycling; refining industry; waste disposal; waste treatment; anaerobic digestion; bibliometrics; fermentation; food waste; hydrolysis; microbial community; priority journal; recycling; Review; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; digestion; food; industrial waste; waste disposal; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Digestion; Food; Industrial Waste; Methane; Refuse Disposal,"Ariunbaatar, J., Panico, A., Yeh, D.H., Pirozzi, F., Lens, P.N.L., Esposito, G., Enhanced mesophilic anaerobic digestion of food waste by thermal pretreatment: substrate versus digestate heating (2015) Waste Manage., 46, pp. 176-181; Akindele, A.A., Sartaj, M., The toxicity effects of ammonia on anaerobic digestion of organic fraction of municipal solid waste (2017) Waste Manage.; Banks, C.J., Zhang, Y., Jiang, Y., Heaven, S., Trace element requirements for stable food waste digestion at elevated ammonia concentrations (2012) Bioresour.

METHODS: Biomedical ontologies selected for their practical impact are examined from a functional perspective. Examples of applications are taken from operational systems and the biomedical literature, with a bias towards recent journal articles. RESULTS: The ontologies under investigation in this survey include SNOMED CT, the Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC), the Foundational Model of Anatomy, the Gene Ontology, RxNorm, the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus, the International Classification of Diseases, the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). The roles played by biomedical ontologies are classified into three major categories: knowledge management (indexing and retrieval of data and information, access to information, mapping among ontologies); data integration, exchange and semantic interoperability; and decision support and reasoning (data selection and aggregation, decision support, natural language processing applications, knowledge discovery). CONCLUSIONS: Ontologies play an important role in biomedical research through a variety of applications. While ontologies are used primarily as a source of vocabulary for standardization and integration purposes, many applications also use them as a source of computable knowledge. Barriers to the use of ontologies in biomedical applications are discussed.",,"article; bibliometrics; decision support system; information system; linguistics; MEDLINE; natural language processing; nomenclature; semantics; Bibliometrics; Decision Support Techniques; Information Management; Natural Language Processing; PubMed; Semantics; Terminology as Topic; Vocabulary, Controlled; MLCS; MLOWN",,"Bodenreider, O.email: olivier@nlm.nih.gov",,,,,,,,09434747,,,18660879.0,English,Yearb Med Inform,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-48349143030

Moreover, it is far from trivial to model how the topic of the whole paper and the contexts of the citation places should affect the selection and ranking of citations. To tackle the problem, we develop a context-aware approach. The core idea is to design a novel non-parametric probabilistic model which can measure the context-based relevance between a citation context and a document. Our approach can recommend citations for a context effectively. Moreover, it can recommend a set of citations for a paper with high quality. We implement a prototype system in CiteSeerX. An extensive empirical evaluation in the CiteSeerX digital library against many baselines demonstrates the effectiveness and the scalability of our approach. © 2010 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2).",bibliometrics; context; gleason's theorem; recommender systems,Bibliometrics; Context-Aware; Context-based; Empirical evaluations; High quality; Non-parametric probabilistic models; Prototype system; Recommendation systems; Recommender systems; Digital libraries; Quantum theory; Research; World Wide Web; Technical writing,"Agrawal, R., Imielinski, T., Swami, A., Mining Association Rules Between Sets of Items in Large Databases (1993) SIGMOD; Aya, S., Lagoze, C., Joachims, T., Citation Classification and its Applications ICKM'05; Banaszek, K., D'Ariano, G., Paris, M., Sacchi, M., Maximum-likelihood estimation of the density matrix (1999) Physical Review A; Basu, C., Hirsh, H., Cohen, W., Nevill-Manning, C., Technical Paper Recommendation: A Study in Combining Multiple Information Sources (2001) J. of Artificial Intelligence Research; Blei, D., Ng, A., Jordan, M., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) J.

There are numerous international and national programs to encourage collaboration, for example, between university and industry researchers. However, little is know about the way in which collaboration changes the impact of a research publication. This paper explores how the impact (average citations per paper) varies with different types of collaboration. A calibrated bibliometric model is derived that demonstrates that collaborating with an author from the home institution or another domestic institution increases the average impact by approximately 0.75 citations while collaborating with an author from a foreign institution increases the impact by about 1.6 citations.",,,"Hicks, D., Katz, J.S., The Changing Shape of British Industrial Research (1997) STEEP Special Report No 6, 6. , University of Sussex, UK; Hicks, D., Katz, J.S., Hospitals: A hidden research system (1996) Science and Public Policy, 23, p. 5; Katz, J.S., Hicks, D.M., Sharp, M., Martin, B.R., The Changing Shape of British Science (1995) STEEP Report No 3, 3. , SPRU, University of Sussex, UK; Katz, J.S., Hicks, D., The Classification of Interdisciplinary Journals: A new approach (1995) Proceedings of the Fifth Biennial Conference of the International Society for Scientometrics and Informatics, , River Forest, Ill, USA; Katz, J.S., Hicks, D.M., A systemic view of British Science (1996) Scientometrics, 35, pp. 133-154; Katz, J.S., Martin, B.R., What is research collaboration?

Virtual and remote labs reduce the costs associated with conventional hands-on labs due to their required equipment, space, and maintenance staff. Furthermore, they provide additional benefits such as supporting distance learning, improving lab accessibility to handicapped people, and increasing safety for dangerous experimentation. This paper analyzes the literature on virtual and remote labs from its beginnings to 2015, identifying the most influential publications, the most researched topics, and how the interest in those topics has evolved along the way. To do so, bibliographical data gathered from ISI Web of Science, Scopus and GRC2014 have been examined using two prominent bibliometric approaches: science mapping and performance analysis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our analysis provides three main findings. The first more precisely highlights the role of demand as a source of innovation. The second illustrates how competences enable firms to match technology with demand and capitalize on technology and demand as sources of innovation. The third unveils a distinction between external and internal sources of innovations. The sources of innovation can be purely external or internally generated competences that enable the firm to integrate external knowledge within its boundaries. Our work contributes to the classic debate by providing a more granular understanding of how technology and demand interact. In discussing our findings, we link our framework to strategy, innovation and entrepreneurship studies that expressly call for a better understanding of technology and demand factors in value creation and capture. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Based on a systematic search of published literature using two leading international databases, the article maps the terrain of work published between 1994 and 2007, in terms of policy topics, lines of inquiry and geographical base, as well as critically evaluating its strengths and weaknesses. The overall objective of the review is to provide a platform for the further development of this field of work.From an initial set of several thousand articles, only 391 were identified as relevant to the focus of inquiry. Of these, 164 were selected for detailed review because they present empirical analyses of health policy change processes within LMIC settings. Examination of these articles clearly shows that LMIC health policy analysis is still in its infancy. There are only small numbers of such analyses, whilst the diversity of policy areas, topics and analytical issues that have been addressed across a large number of country settings results in a limited depth of coverage within this body of work. In addition, the majority of articles are largely descriptive in nature, limiting understanding of policy change processes within or across countries. Nonetheless, the broad features of experience that can be identified from these articles clearly confirm the importance of integrating concern for politics, process and power into the study of health policy. By generating understanding of the factors influencing the experience and results of policy change, such analysis can inform action to strengthen future policy development and implementation. This article, finally, outlines five key actions needed to strengthen the field of health policy analysis within LMICs, including capacity development and efforts to generate systematic and coherent bodies of work underpinned by both the intent to undertake rigorous analytical work and concern to support policy change. © The Author 2008; all rights reserved.",Health policy; Methods; Policy analysis,"conference paper; cultural factor; descriptive research; developing country; document examination; empiricism; financial management; geographic distribution; health care policy; health program; lowest income group; medical information system; medical literature; methodology; organization and management; politics; primary health care; publication; resource allocation; social aspect; Bibliometrics; Databases, Bibliographic; Decision Making, Organizational; Decision Support Techniques; Developing Countries; Empirical Research; Health Policy; Health Services Research; Humans; Policy Making; Politics; Power (Psychology)","Aitken, J.-M., Voices from the inside: Managing district health services in Nepal (1994) International Journal of Health Planning and Management, 9, pp. 309-340; Aliyu, Z.Y., Policy mapping for establishing a national emergency health policy for Nigeria (2002) BMC International Health and Human Rights, 2; Allen, T., Heald, S., HIV/AIDS policy in Africa: What has worked in Uganda and what has failed in Botswana?

In this paper we contribute to the discussion with a methodological reflection and application of multi-stage patent citation analysis for the measurement of inventive progress. Investigating specific patterns of patent citation data, we conclude that single-stage citation analysis cannot reveal technological paths or lineages. Therefore, one should also make use of indirect citations and bibliographical coupling. To measure aspects of cumulative inventive progress, we develop a ""shared specialization measure"" of patent families. We relate this measure to an expert rating of the technological value added in the field of variable valve actuation for internal combustion engines. In sum, the study presents promising evidence for multi-stage patent citation analysis in order to explain aspects of technological change. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Although the report has been widely credited with spawning efforts to study and improve safety in health care, there has been limited objective assessment of its impact. We evaluated the effects of the IOM report on patient safety publications and research awards. Methods: We searched MEDLINE to identify English language articles on patient safety and medical errors published between 1 November 1994 and 1 November 2004. Using interrupted time series analyses, changes in the number, type, and subject matter of patient safety publications were measured. We also examined federal (US only) funding of patient safety research awards for the fiscal years 1995-2004. Results: A total of 5514 articles on patient safety and medical errors were published during the 10 year study period. The rate of patient safety publications increased from 59 to 164 articles per 100 000 MEDLINE publications (p<0.001) following the release of the IOM report. Increased rates of publication were observed for all types of patient safety articles. Publications of original research increased from an average of 24 to 41 articles per 100 000 MEDLINE publications after the release of the report (p<0.001), while patient safety research awards increased from 5 to 141 awards per 100 000 federally funded biomedical research awards (p<0.001). The most frequent subject of patient safety publications before the IOM report was malpractice (6% v 2%, p<0.001) while organizational culture was the most frequent subject (1% v 5%, p<0.001) after publication of the report. Conclusions: Publication of the report ""To Err is Human"" was associated with an increased number of patient safety publications and research awards. The report appears to have stimulated research and discussion about patient safety issues, but whether this will translate into safer patient care remains unknown.",,article; health care; malpractice; medical error; medical information; medical literature; medical research; medical society; MEDLINE; organization; patient safety; publication; Bibliometrics; Humans; Iatrogenic Disease; Institute of Medicine (U.S.); Medical Errors; MEDLINE; Periodicals; Research Support; Safety Management; United States,"Kohn, L.T., Corrigan, J.M., Donaldson, M.S., (2000) To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System, , Institute of Medicine.

Time-dependent bias can occur if such variables are not analyzed appropriately. This study sought to determine the prevalence of such time-dependent bias in highly-cited medical journals. Study design and setting We searched Medline databases to identify all observational studies that used a survival analysis in American Journal of Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, Archives of Internal Medicine, British Medical Journal, Chest, Circulation, Journal of the American Medical Association, Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine between 1998 and 2002. Studies with ""baseline immeasurable"" time-dependent factors were susceptible to time-dependent bias if a time-dependent covariate analysis was not used. Results Of 682 eligible studies, 127 (18.6%, 95% CI 15.8-21.8%) contained a ""baseline immeasurable"" time-dependent factor and 52 (7.6% [5.8-9.9%] of all survival analyses/40.9% [32.3-50.0%] of studies with a time-dependent factor) were susceptible to time-dependent bias. In 35 studies (5.1% [3.7-7.1%]/27.6% [20.5-35.9%]), the bias affected a variable highlighted in the study abstract and correction of the bias could have qualitatively changed the study's conclusion in over half of studies. Conclusion In medical journals, time-dependent bias is concerningly common and frequently affects key factors and the study's conclusion. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Several descriptions of this purportedly new approach of science are often heard in connection with large datasets and the possibilities of mobilizing crowds outside science to assists with observations and classifications. However, other accounts refer to CS as a way of democratizing science, aiding concerned communities in creating data to influence policy and as a way of promoting political decision processes involving environment and health. Objective: In this study we analyse two datasets (N = 1935, N = 633) retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) with the aim of giving a scientometric description of what the concept of CS entails. We account for its development over time, and what strands of research that has adopted CS and give an assessment of what scientific output has been achieved in CS-related projects. To attain this, scientometric methods have been combined with qualitative approaches to render more precise search terms. Results: Results indicate that there are three main focal points of CS. The largest is composed of research on biology, conservation and ecology, and utilizes CS mainly as a methodology of collecting and classifying data. A second strand of research has emerged through geographic information research, where citizens participate in the collection of geographic data. Thirdly, there is a line of research relating to the social sciences and epidemiology, which studies and facilitates public participation in relation to environmental issues and health. In terms of scientific output, the largest body of articles are to be found in biology and conservation research. In absolute numbers, the amount of publications generated by CS is low (N = 1935), but over the past decade a new and very productive line of CS based on digital platforms has emerged for the collection and classification of data. © 2016 Kullenberg, Kasperowski.

Our aim was to inform this debate by comparing the scientific impact of OA journals with subscription journals, controlling for journal age, the country of the publisher, discipline and (for OA publishers) their business model.Methods: The 2-year impact factors (the average number of citations to the articles in a journal) were used as a proxy for scientific impact. The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) was used to identify OA journals as well as their business model. Journal age and discipline were obtained from the Ulrich's periodicals directory. Comparisons were performed on the journal level as well as on the article level where the results were weighted by the number of articles published in a journal. A total of 610 OA journals were compared with 7,609 subscription journals using Web of Science citation data while an overlapping set of 1,327 OA journals were compared with 11,124 subscription journals using Scopus data.Results: Overall, average citation rates, both unweighted and weighted for the number of articles per journal, were about 30% higher for subscription journals. However, after controlling for discipline (medicine and health versus other), age of the journal (three time periods) and the location of the publisher (four largest publishing countries versus other countries) the differences largely disappeared in most subcategories except for journals that had been launched prior to 1996. OA journals that fund publishing with article processing charges (APCs) are on average cited more than other OA journals. In medicine and health, OA journals founded in the last 10 years are receiving about as many citations as subscription journals launched during the same period.Conclusions: Our results indicate that OA journals indexed in Web of Science and/or Scopus are approaching the same scientific impact and quality as subscription journals, particularly in biomedicine and for journals funded by article processing charges. © 2012 Björk and Solomon et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Impact; Open access; Peer review; Scientific publishing,"article; biomedicine; comparative study; engineering; information processing; mathematics; medical literature; peer review; quality control; scientific literature; sociology; bibliometrics; human; journal impact factor; medical research; publishing; Bibliometrics; Biomedical Research; Humans; Journal Impact Factor; Peer Review, Research; Publishing","Björk, B.-C., Welling, P., Laakso, M., Majlender, P., Hedlund, T., Gudnason, G., Open access to the scientific journal literature: situation 2009 (2010) PLoS ONE, 5, pp. e11273. , 10.1371/journal.pone.0011273, 2890572, 20585653; Solomon, D.J., Björk, B.-C., A study of Open Access Journals using article processing charges J Am Soc Info Sci Technol; Dallmeier-Tiessen, S., Darby, R., Goerner, B., Hyppoelae, J., Igo-Kemenes, P., Kahn, D., Lambert, S., van der Stelt, W., Highlights from the SOAP project survey What scientists think about open access publishing, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.5260v2; Dallmeier-Thiessen, S., Goerner, B., Darby, R., Hyppoelae, J., Igo-Kemenes, P., Kahn, D., Lambert, S., van der Stelt, W., Open access publishing - models and attributes (2010), http://edoc.mpg.de/478647, SOAP project report, Max Planck Society digital library; Suber, P., Will open access undermine peer review?

This does not mean, however, that the association between higher step counts and lower weight is causal or that encouraging sedentary individuals to increase step counts helps them lose weight. METHODS: In this meta-analysis, we searched 6 electronic databases and contacted pedometer experts to identify pedometer-based walking studies without a dietary intervention that reported weight change as an outcome. We included randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies published after January 1, 1995, in either English or Japanese, with 5 or more adult participants and at least 1 cohort enrolled in a pedometer-based walking intervention lasting at least 4 weeks. RESULTS: Nine studies met the study inclusion criteria. Cohort sample size ranged from 15 to 106, for a total of 307 participants, 73% of whom were women and 27% of whom were men. The duration of the intervention ranged from 4 weeks to 1 year, with a median duration of 16 weeks. The pooled estimate of mean weight change from baseline using a fixed-effects model and combining data from all 9 cohorts was -1.27 kg (95% confidence interval, -1.85 to -0.70 kg). Longer intervention duration was associated with greater weight change. On average, participants lost 0.05 kg per week during the interventions. CONCLUSION: Pedometer-based walking programs result in a modest amount of weight loss. Longer programs lead to more weight loss than shorter programs.",Exercise; Obesity; Overweight; Pedometer; Physical activity; Walking; Weight loss,"analytical equipment; clinical trial; cohort analysis; exercise; human; meta analysis; obesity; pedometer; physical activity; review; systematic review; therapy effect; treatment duration; walking; weight change; weight reduction; Adult; Bibliometrics; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Databases, Bibliographic; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Physiologic; Obesity; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Walking; Weight Loss","Overweight and Obesity: Obesity Trends: U.S. Obesity Trends 1985-2004, , http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/obesity/trend/maps, Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Accessed: December 14, 2007; Mokdad, A.H., Ford, E.S., Bowman, B.A., Prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and obesity-related health risk factors, 2001 (2003) JAMA, 289 (1), pp. 76-79; Boyle, J.P., Honeycutt, A.A., Narayan, K.M., Projection of diabetes burden through 2050: Impact of changing demography and disease prevalence in the U.S (2001) Diabetes Care, 24 (11), pp. 1936-1940; Knowler, W.C., Barrett-Connor, E., Fowler, S.E., Reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes with lifestyle intervention or metformin (2002) N Engl J Med, 346 (6), pp. 393-403; Hornbuckle, L.M., Bassett Jr, D.R., Thompson, D.L., Pedometer-determined walking and body composition variables in African-American women (2005) Med Sci Sports Exerc, 37 (6), pp. 1069-1074; Wyatt HR, Peters JC, Reed GW, Barry M, Hill JO.

There is growing interest in shared medical decision making among patients, physicians, and policy makers. This requires patients to interpret increasing amounts of medical information, much of which is uncertain. Little is known about the optimal approaches to or outcomes of communicating uncertainty about the risks and benefits of treatments. Methods. The authors reviewed the literature on various issues related to uncertainty in decision making: conceptualizing uncertainty, identifying its potential sources, assessing uncertainty, potential methods of communicating uncertainty, potential outcomes of communicating uncertainty, and current practices and recommendations by expert groups on communicating uncertainty. Results. There are multiple sources of uncertainty in most medical decisions. There are conceptual differences in how researchers define uncertainty and its sources, as well as in its measurement. The few studies that have assessed alternate means of communicating uncertainty dealt mostly with presenting uncertainty about probabilities. Both patients' and physicians' interpretation of and responses to uncertainty may depend on their personal characteristics and values and may be affected by the manner in which uncertainty is communicated. Conclusions. Research has not yet identified best practices for communicating uncertainty to patients about harms and benefits of treatment. More conceptual, qualitative, and quantitative studies are needed to explore fundamental questions about how people process, interpret, and respond to various types of uncertainty inherent in clinical decisions.",Decision making; Risk communication; Uncertainty,"conceptual framework; medical decision making; medical information; review; risk assessment; risk benefit analysis; uncertainty; Adaptation, Psychological; Bibliometrics; Communication; Decision Making; Humans; Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care); Patient Care; Patient Participation; Physician-Patient Relations; Risk Assessment; Uncertainty; United States","Braddock III, C., Fihn, S.D., Levinson, W., Jonsen, A.R., Pearlman, R.A., How doctors and patients discuss routine clinical decisions: Informed decision making in the outpatient setting (1997) J Gen Intern Med., 12 (6), pp. 339-45; Ch, B., Edwards, K.A., Hasenberg, N.M., Laidley, T.L., Levinson, W., Informed decision making in outpatient practice: Time to get back to basics (1999) JAMA., 282 (24), pp. 2313-20; Woolf, S., Chan, E.C., Harris, R., Promoting informed choice: Transforming health care to dispense knowledge for decision making (2005) Ann Intern Med., 143 (4), pp. 293-300; Stokey, E., Zechouser, R., (1978) A Primer for Policy Analysis, , New York: WW Norton & Company;; (2007) BMJ Clinical Evidence, , http://www.clinicalevidence.com/ceweb/about/guide.jsp, 14 March Available from:; Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, , http://www.m-w.com/, Available from:; Hilton, B.A., Perceptions of uncertainty: Its relevance to life-threatening and chronic illness (1992) Crit Care Nurs., 12 (2), pp. 70-3; McCormick, K.M., A concept analysis of uncertainty in illness (2002) J Nurs Scholarsh, 34 (2), p. 127; Mishel, M.H., Reconceptualization of the uncertainty in illness theory (1990) Image J Nurs Sch., 22 (4), pp. 256-62; Mishel, M.H., The measurement of uncertainty in illness (1981) Nurs Res., 30 (5), pp. 258-63; Taylor, B.N., Kuyatt, C.E., (1994) Guidelines for Evaluating and Expressing the Uncertainty of NIST Measurement Results.

Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), one of the largest administrative health care databases around the world, has been used widely in academic studies. This study analyzed 383 NHIRD studies published between 2000 and 2009 to quantify the effects on overall growth, scholar response, and spread of the study fields. The NHIRD studies expanded rapidly in both quantity and quality since the first study was published in 2000. Researchers usually collaborated to share knowledge, which was crucial to process the NHIRD data. However, once the fundamental problem had been overcome, success to get published became more reproducible. NHIRD studies were also published diversely in a growing number of journals. Both general health and clinical science studies benefited from NHIRD. In conclusion, this new research material widely promotes scientific production in a greater magnitude. The experience of Taiwan's NHIRD should encourage national- or institutional-level data holders to consider re-using their administrative databases for academic purposes. © 2010 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Administrative health care database; Bibliometric analysis; Knowledge growth; National Health Insurance Research Database,,"Berger, M.L., Mamdani, M., Atkins, D., Johnson, M.L., Good research practices for comparative effectiveness research: Defining, reporting and interpreting nonrandomized studies of treatment effects using secondary data sources: The ISPOR good research practices for retrospective database analysis task force report-part I (2009) Value in Health, 12 (8), pp. 1044-1052; Chen, T.J., Chen, Y.C., Hwang, S.J., Chou, L.F., International collaboration of clinical medicine research in Taiwan, 1990-2004: A bibliometric analysis (2007) Journal of the Chinese Medical Association, 70 (3), pp. 110-116; Deshazo, J.P., Lavallie, D.L., Wolf, F.M., Publication trends in the medical informatics literature: 20 years of ""Medical Informatics"" in MeSH (2009) BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making, 9, p. 7; Diamond, C.C., Mostashari, F., Shirky, C., Collecting and sharing data for population health: A new paradigm (2009) Health Affairs, 28 (2), pp. 454-466; Egghe, L., (2005) Power laws in the information production process: Lotkaian informetrics, , Oxford, UK: Elsevier; Fernandez-Cano, A., Torralbo, M., Vallejo, M., Reconsidering Price's model of scientific growth: An overview (2004) Scientometrics, 61 (3), pp. 301-321; Gupta, B.M., Karisiddappa, C.R., Modeling the growth of literature in the area of theoretical population genetics (2000) Scientometrics, 49 (2), pp. 321-355; Harpe, S.E., Using secondary data sources for pharmaco-epidemiology and outcomes research (2009) Pharmacotherapy, 29 (2), pp. 138-153; Hayes, R.M., The mathematical foundations of bibliometrics (2000) The web of knowledge: A festschrift in honor of Eugene Garfield, , B.

After locating terahertz sources within the broader context of terahertz systems, an overview is given of the range of available sources, emphasizing recent developments. The focus then narrows to terahertz sources that rely on surface phenomena. Three are highlighted. Optical rectification, usually thought of as a bulk process, may in addition exhibit a surface contribution, which, in some cases, predominates. Transient surface currents, for convenience often separated into drift and diffusion currents, are well understood according to Monte Carlo modelling. Finally, terahertz surface emission by mechanical means - in the absence of photoexcitation - is described. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.",from; surfaces; terahertz,Surfaces; Diffusion currents; from; Monte Carlo modelling; Optical rectifications; Science and Technology; Surface contribution; Tera Hertz; Terahertz surfaces; Physics,"(2014), www.scopus.com, as at 31 March; Köhler, R., Tredicucci, A., Beltram, F., Beere, H.E., Linfield, E.H., Davies, A.G., Ritchie, D.A., Rossi, F., Terahertz semiconductor-heterostructure laser (2002) Nature, 417, pp. 156-159. , 10.1038/417156a; Tonouchi, M., Cutting-edge terahertz technology (2007) Nature Photon., 1, pp. 97-105. , 10.1038/nphoton.2007.3; Siegel, P.H., Terahertz technology (2002) IEEE Trans.

In the interactions between the social network of (first-order) authors and the network of their reflexive (that is, second-order) communications, a sub-textual code of communication with a distributed character has emerged. The recursive operation of this dual-layered network induces the perception of a cognitive dimension in scientific communication. Citation analysis reflects on citation practices. Reference lists are aggregated in scientometric analysis using one (or sometimes two) of the available contexts to reduce the complexity: geometrical representations ('mappings') of dynamic operations are reflected in corresponding theories of citation. For example, a sociological interpretation of citations can be distinguished from an information-theoretical one. The specific contexts represented in the modern citation can be deconstructed from the perspective of the cultural evolution of scientific communication.",,,"Abernathy, W.J., Clark, K.B., Innovation: Mapping the winds of creative destruction (1985) Research Policy, 14, pp. 3-22; Adair, W.C., Citation indexes for scientific literature?

A whole generation of secondary journals, pre-appraised evidence libraries and periodically updated electronic texts are now available to clinicians. However, not all systematic reviews are of high quality, and it is important to be able to critically assess their validity and applicability. This article is an Illustrated guide for conducting systematic reviews. A clear understanding of the process will provide clinicians with the tools to judiciously appraise reviews and interpret them. We hope that it will enable clinicians to conduct systematic reviews, generate high-quality evidence, and contribute to the evidence-based medicine movement. © The National Medical Journal of India 2004.",,evidence based medicine; information processing; practice guideline; quality control; review; scientific literature; systematic review; validation process; Bibliometrics; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Meta-Analysis; Quality Control; Randomized Controlled Trials; Reproducibility of Results; Review Literature,"Sackett, D.L., Rosenberg, W.M., Gray, J.A., Haynes, R.B., Richardson, W.S., Evidence based medicine: What it is and what it isn't (1996) BMJ, 312, pp. 71-72; Guyatt, G.H., Rennie, D., (2002) Users' Guides to the Medical Literature.
